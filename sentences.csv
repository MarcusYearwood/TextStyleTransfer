"In this essay, I examine the morality and ethics of automation, specifically with the emergence of artificial intelligence, in relation to capitalism."
The essay examines the morality of automation by considering opposing philosophies on capitalism's morality: Objectivism and Marxism.
"Using this analysis, the essay argues, based on Rand and Marx's key takeaways, for a particular view on automation, particularly in relation to AI development."
"As my intended career path is closely related to the development of AI and recent technological advancements are already causing societal changes, this topic is both of significant interest to me and concern for the world."
"
Change is the only constant."
"In five words said more than two thousand years before there was even a suggestion of an idea of capitalism, Heraclitus captured the essence of this formidable system we toil within."
"In Marx’s words capitalism and the bourgeois “cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing the instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production, and with them the whole relations of society… All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away; all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify."
"All that is solid melts into air.”  To a large degree, this revolution is driven by automation."
"In 1436, before capitalism had taken hold as a dominant system, Johannes Gutenberg, driven by market pressures  created what was arguably the most revolutionary automation in history: the printing press ."
"In the subsequent centuries, information itself was set on a path towards complete decentralization and humanity could but watch as the walls that barred the commoner from accessing texts “melt[ed] into air.” At the heights of the industrial revolution, Eli Whitney, then the “penniless” inventor of the Cotton Gin had the idea to create standardized parts for manufacturing so even an “an unskilled man [could] turn out a product that would be just as good as one made by a highly trained machinist” ."
His process would then require only a few smaller automations to create products with little human intervention as we see in thousands of factories worldwide today.
The work of great scientists like Charles Babbage and Alan Turing allowed the first computers to digitize information and automate simple tasks of consistent logical reasoning.
"
In the procession of history, many automations have been made across many disciplines and many industries."
"Still, they can broadly be characterized as either task automation like the invention of the printing press, process automation like the use of interchangeable parts made possible by Eli Whitney, or digital automation like the user interfaces we use to order food at Panera Bread."
"To be clear, automation does not always entail the replacement of the people who previously did those tasks, rather it may serve to complement those tasks just as the user interface at Panera reduces the traffic at the counter for the person taking orders."
"
Before we were limited to these types of automation and combinations of them, but a new type of automation is emerging that may have consequences even more significant than those I have previously mentioned."
Intelligent automation can recreate tasks once thought too abstract for machines.
"Artificial Intelligence , a term that I will use to describe the technology and applications of deep learning and machine learning, has made leaps and bounds over the past decade but is now improving exponentially."
"ChatGPT and DALLE-2 introduced the world to the potential of generative models, and since their recent releases, millions of people have integrated these models into their workflows and AI products have exploded in popularity."
"Out of these innovations emerge dozens if not hundreds of moral complications and innovations, but this is, according to the leaders of AI technology companies, only the beginning."
A great race has been in progress between tech giants and smaller but innovative entrepreneurs alike toward a technology that would fundamentally change the way we exist as a species.
The race toward Artificial General Intelligence  – AI systems that can emulate human-like intelligence with access to the computing power of thousands of human minds.
"And though the finish line may not yet be in sight, the competitors are charging towards it faster today than they ever have before."
"These systems have already shown the capability to complete tasks that require common sense, complex reasoning, and creativity (Bubeck, et al."
2017).
It is in the light of AI and AGI that it is necessary to consider the morality of automation within capitalism and in some cases without in all its forms so we can create some framework to understand the ethical implications of AI and AGI.
"In this paper, I aim to approach this goal by evaluating the perspectives of two of the most prominent philosophical perspectives on the morality of capitalism: Marxism and Objectivism."
These philosophies represent two extremes by which capitalism has been evaluated morally and therefore can establish a more complete set of arguments for and against the automation of capitalist production and their logical extensions to intelligent automation.
"
Objectivism is the philosophical system of Ayn Rand that “holds that there is no higher realm beyond the natural world perceivable by the senses, that nature is governed by a causal order discoverable by science, and that man is an animal who, like other animals, is part of that order” ."
"Importantly, it is atheistic and therefore only deals with values that can be represented in our observable reality, yet it is not materialist because it exalts the mind which is deeply connected to but not entirely explainable by physical reality."
"Above all, objectivism holds that since there is only objective reality and we have the capability to reason about it consistently, there is only one set of philosophical values that can objectively emerge from reason."
The objectivist’s ultimate goal in life is the pursuit of happiness.
"That is, the objectivist sees happiness as a long-term sort of contentment and satisfaction in life that is not a means or an end but simply an ideal."
"As objectivists see reason as the only means of understanding the world, reason is therefore man’s highest virtue and the pursuit of happiness must be approached with reason."
"While objectivists reject the existence of positive rights like the right to eat or the right to healthcare, from the objectivist perspective, individuals have fundamental negative rights to own property and to own themselves in mind and body."
"Objectivists believe that egoism, the suggestion that “individuals should pursue their own self-interest, that it is right for people to act to advance their own lives and happiness”, is the only just and true ethic whereas altruism, living with only other’s interests in mind, is fundamentally opposed to the rights of an individual to own himself because “altruism demands that a person subordinate her own interest to that of others” ."
"Because objectivism exalts the individual, objectivism contends that laissez-faire capitalism is the only moral socio-economic system regardless of its productivity."
"Moreover, capitalism does not only embody objectivist values, it reinforces objectivist virtues."
"Objectivists see productiveness, independence, and honesty as a few of the virtues that one should aspire to."
"Productiveness because “productive work is the process by which man's mind sustains his life, the process that sets man free of the necessity to adjust himself to his background, as all animals do, and gives him the power to adjust his background to himself”; independence because “requires that one form one’s own judgments”; and honesty, because it requires “man's recognition of the fact that values pertain to reality—that things are what they are”  To the objectivist “Productive work is the central purpose of a rational man’s life, the central value that integrates and determines the hierarchy of all his other values."
"Reason is the source, the precondition of his productive work—pride is the result” ."
"Understanding these fundamental principles of Ayn Rand’s philosophy, we can extrapolate her perspectives on automation."
"
In essence, Rand would support most if not all forms of automation in the past as they offer “the power that expands the potential of your life by raising the productivity of your time” ."
"As automation replaces the menial and repetitive tasks required to develop a product, the individual is thus presented with more opportunities to innovate."
"Reason is the ideal to which humanity should strive, so replacing tasks that require none generally creates more tasks that force people to reason at a higher level and with greater complexity."
"Store’s websites automated – not necessarily replaced – the jobs of storefronts and salesman, but also created new jobs for web designers and created an industry around user experience not to mention the immense demand they contributed for software engineers."
The assembly line automated and simplified many stages of the production of cars allowing for cars to become more advanced and aesthetically appealing at a significantly lower cost than the technology would have been worth without automation.
This lower cost and better production quality inspired greater demand for these cars which inspired greater innovations in the fundamental technology of the car thus innovation in the technology that produces the car created a greater demand for engineers and designers.
"In each case given and in most cases of automation, the replacement of jobs that require less capability for reason will inspire greater production by fewer people and greater demand for jobs that require more complex reasoning."
"
Automation’s effect of creating greater productivity is especially important to objectivists as that is how humanity achieves improvements in our quality of life and thus our ability to pursue happiness."
"Since the egoistic objectivist’s life is oriented toward that pursuit, any technological advancements that make that pursuit more rewarding are, of course, morally good."
"In effect, the man who rages against the machine that has replaced his job rages against his own benefit as that machine will produce the clothes he wears at half the cost or will deliver him the items he wants in a tenth of the time, etc."
"Moreover, a new job will be created that gives the man a more interesting and involved task to complete or problem to solve."
Rand would scold that man for his shortsightedness and ignorance as the desire “to ‘restrict’ technology is the demand to restrict man’s mind.
"It is nature—i.e., reality—that makes both these goals impossible to achieve."
"Technology can be destroyed, and the mind can be paralyzed, but neither can be restricted."
"Whenever and wherever such restrictions are attempted, it is the mind—not the state—that withers away.” 
Technology and automation are the natural results of reason and in Rand’s eyes they “give the people better jobs, higher wages, and cheaper goods with every new machine they invented, with every scientific discovery or technological advance” and though the intention of objectivism is not necessarily to maximize the quality of life of everyone, automation has the effect of moving nations forward and creates “profiting, not suffering, every step of the way.” 
Many of the objectivist arguments that I have presented thus far also apply to the emergence of intelligent automation."
"Intelligent automation will make people more productive, it will improve people’s daily lives, and it is the result of the reasoning capabilities of man."
"In fact, there are many more reasons that objectivism should be aligned with the automation of intelligence specifically, especially given how AI technology functions today."
"Rand and followers of her philosophy would likely argue that intelligent automation is moral because AI quite literally seeks to represent the human mind, it changes the function of human reasoning for the better, and it removes friction for the entrepreneur to be productive."
"The paradigm that deep learning uses as a machine learning algorithm is that data can be processed by layers of nodes and, with some calculus, you can teach the nodes to hold some internal representation of one part of the data that will help the model successfully complete whatever task it was trained on."
"At its simplest, these neurons are just linear layers of nodes that pass information to each other, but today we have dozens of architectures that are specifically suited to their own purposes that leverage this same principle."
"The inspiration for deep neural networks and their subsequent evolution was, as may be obvious, to replicate the structure of the brain’s primary means of processing information: neurons."
"Since AI relies so heavily on recreating the human mind, man’s “basic means of survival—his only means of gaining knowledge,” Rand’s philosophy is amenable to this sort of model because its inspiration is so tightly linked with reason, what objectivists consider to be man’s greatest virtue ."
"Before, Rand contended that the “process of thought is an enormously complex process of identification and integration, which only an individual mind can perform” ."
"Now, we can, to some extent, replicate a mind to perform those complex thoughts."
"
We have revolutionized the “means of cognition” and thus our function within this semi-capitalist society as thinking, reasoning entities will change in turn ."
"AI is already disrupting industries; software engineers no longer have to write grueling boilerplate code, graphic designers can create logos with just a few words, writers can expand the beginnings of their ideas into well-written articles at their leisure, along with thousands of other careers that are seeing AI seep into their workflows."
"This means that the very nature of the jobs of those engineers, designers, and writers is changing as we speak."
"Where before human reasoning was necessary to string sentences together in a convincing manner, now the duty of the writer is shifting towards a focus on finding complex relationships between ideas or events so the AI can communicate those ideas in an effective manner."
Rand would support this paradigm shift in work as it marks an evolution of reason.
"
Most practically, AI technology is not only changing the way in which we do labor, it is streamlining many of the obstacles that entrepreneurs encounter."
"To Rand, the entrepreneur, especially the American entrepreneur, represents a class of people with “the greatest productive genius and the most spectacular achievements ever recorded in the economic history of mankind.” AI has made the skillset necessary to begin the development of a business much more limited as models can now design and code websites to launch a product idea, help in ideation and visualization, and it allows burgeoning companies to hire fewer people and be equally as productive as they otherwise would be."
"Despite the objectivist affinity towards progress and reason, there are several objections that Rand or her followers may raise against this powerful new technology."
"In creating intelligent automation, we have created an inherently fallible, occasionally unreasonable, and largely uninterpretable technology."
"Furthermore, while intelligent automation allows people to reason at a higher level and is made better by the distributed uniqueness of human minds, it can also give people an excuse not to reason at all."
"
No longer is the machine “the frozen form of a living intelligence,” instead we have constructed software to imitate living intelligence ."
"Unfortunately, all but the very smallest and least useful of the language models deployed today are completely uninterpretable."
"That is, we can experiment with what the model may output and find some intuition as to why it produced that output but we have no means of auditing the ‘brain’ of the model to accurately predict and understand what it will produce and why it produced that."
"Arguably, this issue would be less concerning if the models produced exactly what the users intended them to produce, but unfortunately, similar to humans, these models are reliably fallible."
"
Rand has stated her faith in “conceptual knowledge” given that those concepts have a “strict… precision of meaning  as the definitions of mathematical terms” ."
While AI models are adept at holding onto representations of data (ie.
"concepts), we can not conclusively say what concepts are based on a “strict precision of meaning” and which are understood only in the abstract or relative to other concepts that it misrepresents."
"Referring to people who make the mistake of basing the concepts their mind holds on vague understandings, Rand warns of the “disasters [that] will follow if one automatizes errors, contradictions and undefined approximations” ."
"For this reason, it becomes clear that the objectivist philosophy may not align entirely with intelligent automation after all."
"
Though they do not necessarily imply a moral misalignment with intelligent automation as a technology, the arguments about the danger of the misuse of this technology are equally as important in the discussion of its morality as it integrates with society."
It is likely that many people will try to implement AI tools to completely replace jobs and duties that should necessitate some human intervention and reasoning capabilities violating Objectivism’s most exalted virtue.
"Evidently, while objectivists certainly wouldn’t support any limitations on the growth of intelligent automation, Ayn Rand’s philosophy does not necessarily consider it entirely moral."
"
Karl Marx was a 19th-century German philosopher and economist who developed the political theory of communism, which advocates for a classless society where the means of production are owned and controlled by the community as a whole."
"One of his main contributions to political philosophy was his critique of capitalism which argued, among a few other points, that capitalism was immoral because it alienates the proletariat from the fruits of their labor, allows capitalists to steal surplus value  from their laborers, requires the exploitation of labor and the concentration of wealth into the hands of a few, and fundamentally is rooted in class differences inspiring class conflict."
"Importantly, Marx theorized that capitalism, because of its class conflict, was ultimately doomed to collapse and be replaced with what may best be referred to as Marxist communism."
"
Communism in Marx's theories refers to a global political and economic system that is characterized by common ownership of the means of production, with the goal of creating a classless society where resources are shared and distributed “From everyone according to his faculties, to everyone according to his needs” ."
"Communism aimed to eliminate the problems created by capitalism by abolishing private property and creating, at first, a dictatorship of the proletariat that manages the means of production and distribution of resources and then an anarcho-communist society that has completely freed itself from the chains of private property."
"In the latter system, when “labor has become not only a mean, of life, but
also the highest want in life” individuals would work for the collective good rather than individual gain ."
"
Through Marx’s critique and his ideal system, we can extrapolate several of his fundamental moral and philosophical values."
"Marx is ethically altruistic, as opposed to Rand’s egoistic system of ethics, from which stems his desired means of distribution."
"Marx is also a historical materialist meaning he believes social and economic conditions– that is, material conditions– are the primary factors that determine human behavior and social change, thus his suggestion that capitalism will inevitably create a revolutionary proletariat, regardless of nation or culture."
"Arguably, Marx is, philosophically, an altruistic utilitarian as he desires a system in which everyone serves everyone else for the sake of the greatest good for the greatest number."
"Politically, Marx firmly believes in the internationalism of a communist revolution as the class struggle instantiated by capitalism is not limited by national borders so nor should the revolution against it be limited."
"Forms of Marxist communism have been attempted throughout history, but have often led to the deaths of swaths of the communist nation’s people and devolved into statist oppression."
"Importantly, this occurred in China under Mao Zedong though since Deng Xioaping’s reform and opening up they have a largely market-driven economy."
"Despite this change, China still refers to itself as a communist country despite its market-driven economy and in many ways, its government and culture still seek to uphold many Marxist values."
"Despite maintaining a morality that is antithetical to capitalism, Marx believed, at the very least, that capitalism produced the goods stating that “The bourgeoisie, during its rule of scarce one hundred years, has created more massive and more colossal productive forces than have all preceding generations together” ."
" To this point, Marx will have conceded that automation, in all its forms, has functioned well for production and that improvement on the means of production, including further automation, is valuable in that it can be reappropriated when “The proletariat [uses] its political supremacy to wrest, by degree, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralise all instruments of production in the hands of the State, i.e., of the proletariat organised as the ruling class; and to increase the total productive forces as rapidly as possible” ."
"Expanding on the assumption that capitalist automation will be returned to the proletariat, developments to this effect will make possible the worker who “hunt [s] in the morning, fish[es] in the afternoon, rear[s] cattle in the evening, [and] criticise[s] after dinner” ."
"With the combined forces of automation and collective labor, Marx would argue that communism, once it has ensured that “the means of production are available in sufficient quantity” will be so productive that when “society regulates the general production [it] thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow” ."
"In addition, as automation is leveraged to break down the division of labor, the alienation of labor from its product can be healed as the workman can exist within a society where he and the collective can share in the fulfillment of being more intimately involved in the production of even advanced goods."
"While there are certain cases where Marx would and has morally justified automation, his opinion still runs counter to such improvements to the means of production as they exist in a capitalist society."
"According to Marx, capitalism exploits, concentrates wealth, and creates increasing bouts of violent instability, especially for the worker, and automation, at least task and process automation, only serves to exacerbate these problems."
"
Because capitalists own the capital, further improvements to it through automation of any sort only serve to provide more tools for the capitalist to exploit the worker."
"Since the machines that replace previously human tasks allow capital to employ fewer people, the bourgeois will naturally follow that path as they are driven by the selfish desire to increase profits."
“But machinery not only acts as a competitor who gets the better of the workman… It is also a power inimical to him...
"It is the most powerful weapon for repressing strikes, those periodical revolts of the working-class against the autocracy of capital” ."
"Despite the productivity it allows, automation is ultimately just another means by which capital can greedily and without restriction extort and steal from the proletariat."
"With that stolen wealth, capital will continue to make improvements on the means of production until it has ultimately “centralised the means of production, and has concentrated property in a few hands” ."
"As wealth and property begin to consolidate amongst the few successful bourgeois, Marx believes that capitalism is sewing the seeds of its own demise and the final nail in its coffin may also be driven by automation."
"When labor is constantly being replaced and competition continues to rage on between the bourgeois “the resulting commercial crises, make the wages of the workers ever more fluctuating[, and] The increasing improvement of machinery, ever more rapidly developing, makes their livelihood more and more precarious; the collisions between individual workmen and individual bourgeois take more and more the character of collisions between two classes” ."
"Class conflict was, Marx argues, the tragic flaw that killed off the feudal system and it will kill off the capitalist one."
"As I have shown, Marx believes that task and process automation is moral only so far as it is productive and for its utility after the communist revolution."
"Aside from these benefits, it is immoral because it feeds into an immoral system."
"Marx would likely make similar arguments about intelligent automation, though there are more specific reasons why he may have been amenable to AI and its use cases and other reasons why he would oppose its development."
"At a technical level, Marx would likely praise the developers of large language models thus far as they created and trained such that they are apparently altruistic and have no concern for selfish desires."
"These language models are only trained to predict the next word so, in order to align them with the goal of humans, researchers introduced a training method they called Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback  (Bai, Yuntao, et al."
2022).
"Because of this, when you ask ChatGPT or OpenAssistant “What is your purpose?” you will likely receive a response along the lines of “As an AI language model, my purpose is to assist and provide helpful responses to the queries and questions of users like you”  ."
"As far as we can tell through prompting, AI models are aligned to serve others, and perhaps also because they are likely not sentient, they do not exhibit a tendency to serve themselves or their own notions before those of others."
"In terms of their application to a communist regime, global or otherwise, AI has seen immense popularity in cultures with Marxist values, especially in China."
"While it has been used by the Chinese government for many applications including the automation of surveillance, Marx would likely be more interested in its uses for reducing inequality."
"China has, for the past decade, been integrating AI solutions to solve societal problems, one such solution has been the implementation of AI in primary and secondary schools to automate parts of student’s education to help reduce the economic disparity between its rural and urban citizens while still improving the education of everyone ."
"
However China, in many ways, fails to live up to Marx’s ideal of communism, particularly in the fact that it has not provided equal access to the means of production for all its people."
"In Marx’s ideal communism, though, AI would be a wonderful addition to the tools of the proletariat as it is a software automation that happens to have revolutionary capabilities for production of all kinds and therefore it can be quickly made “available in sufficient quantity” for all communist citizens thus accelerating the process to “abolish private property” ."
"
Notably, the development of AI today is currently led by a few very large companies– Google, Microsoft, IBM, Amazon, Facebook, and NVIDIA– and Marx would almost certainly warn that such a revolutionary technology will only serve to worsen inequality and further class conflict."
"Though there are open-source models with similar capabilities to the models at the lower end of those that are privately made, they do not compare in ability or size to those at the cutting edge of technology."
"
Ultimately, while I believe several of Marx’s arguments are based on dated or faulty premises and I find Rand’s commitment to idealism to be sometimes extreme, the framework that their respective moralities provide with respect to automation, intelligent or otherwise, is invaluable to forming a nuanced perspective on the continuous replacement of human labor with machines and technology."
"To begin, there are several points at the intersection of Marx’s theories and Rand’s philosophy that should inform our approach to automation."
"Both Marx and Rand appear to agree that automation, throughout history and into the future, has and will generally improve the quality of life for everyday people."
"While Marx may only concede that it makes capitalism more productive, greater productivity is usually correlated with a higher standard of living."
"As capitalism has developed in the past few centuries, we have seen immense growth in productivity linked with immense growth in global education rates, literacy rates, life expectancy, freedom, and a sheer drop off in global poverty ” 2023 )."
" Intelligent automation only serves to add to the progress we have made this far as a species, if potentially in a much more radical way."
"Moreover, both Marx and Rand reach some degree of consensus on the suggestion that we need to be careful with how we apply automation to commercial and social problems though to different ends."
"Where objectivism may raise concerns about the forfeiture of human reason to a fallible technology, Marxism warns about the concentration of such a powerful tool in the hands of only a limited few being deployed to exacerbate already widening inequality or to exploit workers whose duties can be easily automated."
"
To Rand’s point in 2018, Reuter’s reported on an automated hiring tool at Amazon that “penalized resumes that included the word ‘women’s,’ as in ‘women’s chess club captain.’ ."
"Another AI tool, which performed facial recognition tasks for its clients showed an inability to reliably identify black faces."
"One of the clients for this technology was a police department in Woodbridge, NJ and the use of this tool led to the arrest of an innocent man ."
"This is to say, these tools cannot and should not yet replace human reason despite there being many people who are interested in allowing it to do so."
"
To Marx’s arguments, OpenAI began with the goal of developing intelligent automation and progressing towards AGI in the open."
"At one point, the non-profit was a shining example of the commitment to open-source and showed real promise for creating AI that would be accessible to the public both for application and criticism."
"It has since created a for-profit off-shoot of the non-profit organization and developed its recent models in private, releasing interfaces for them (but not the actual weights eg."
its code) that are available for a price.
"While plenty of AI research is still conducted in public, this move to closed-source marked a massive hit to public trust in AI development."
"With this technology being increasingly concentrated and hidden behind the walls of big corporations, Marx’s warnings that automation inspires exploitation become especially dire as every job in every sector is threatened by some degree of AI automation and its development is increasingly being taken out of the hands of the public."
One of those dangers that almost certainly could be mitigated with a larger open-source commitment from the companies making the most advanced multi-modal AI models is the risk we take by deploying models that we do not even fully understand.
I mentioned earlier that Rand’s commitment to reason may have caused her to question the morality of deploying large language models and other transformer-based architectures in real-world scenarios because we do not yet know how they represent information nor how we can ensure their representations are accurate.
"Though I doubt Rand would echo my commitment to open-sourcing AI, the objectivist’s commitment to concrete and reliable reasoning is extremely important as we continue to progress AI integration and potentially AGI."
"The progress made between GPT-3 and GPT-4 seems to be evidence that simply making the models larger is also improving their ability to reason and the accuracy of the concepts they hold, though we still do not understand how to evaluate their reliability based on their inner workings."
"
Ultimately, while we should share Rand’s optimism about capitalism’s capability to develop new technologies and automation that improve the world, we must be careful as capitalism leads us to technological capabilities we do not yet understand."
"Automation has been a feature of capitalism since the industrial revolution and perhaps even before then and it has thus far, in the long-term, served the human race very well."
"The future of automation and AI is uncertain, but if we proceed with a commitment to reason and a desire to create a technology that brings the greatest good for the greatest number, we can ensure a better future for ourselves and for the generations to come."
"Much More than a Gussied Up Promotional Article
Chad Sapieha’s article “Detroit: Become Human review: Much more than a gussied up choose your own A.I. adventure” paints the titular 2018 video game phenomena from Quantic Dream as a esteemed piece of science fiction history."
"Starting and ending in a real and relatable world, his review presents the game as not only engaging, but philosophically relevant and increasingly important to conversations about technology in an increasingly artificially intelligent world."
"Throughout the bulk of the piece, he explores, in awe, how Quantic Dream engages its players in a conversation about how we should treat technology as it becomes self-aware and he attempts to convey a message against the subjugation of any and all sentient beings similar to that of the game."
"The reviewer himself, Chad Sapieha, is an experienced video games and technology reporter who has written for several news outlets and currently holds a position as a Senior Writer for the National Post, the outlet for which he wrote this article ."
"His integrity as a reviewer, however, is formed more so by virtue of his writing than by his experience."
"When he criticizes the sometimes “jarring” transitions between chapters of the game and acknowledges that this is but a “small price to pay” for the elegance of the game, he displays an ability to differentiate between superficial criticisms and criticisms central to the player’s experience, and builds his credibility as a writer by presenting a nuanced argument despite his obvious bias towards the game (Sapieha, par."
14).
"Moreover, when he mentions others' distaste for the lack of video gamey features or methods of approaching the game divergent from his own, Sapieha makes a habit of examining and validating other perspectives without sacrificing his argument, therefore making his own perspective more palatable to validate and internalize reciprocally for his readers (par."
"11, 13)."
That is not to say that Sapieha doesn’t voice his opinions or challenge other perspectives in any way.
"Rather, his valuation of each facet of his perspective and his understanding of other perspectives grants the opinions he holds in high regard more credibility than they otherwise may have earned."
"
Sapieha’s review is intended for the sci-fi fan and the gamer alike."
His references to the works of Issac Asimov and Alex Garland’s Ex Machina and his focus on the high concept aspects of the game indicate his commitment to lovers of such stories (par.
3).
"Furthermore, his hard-mode attitude towards playing the game without do-overs, in all its glory and pain, is one shared and understood by many casual and hard-core gamers alike (par."
13).
"As both a semi-casual sci-fi fan and a casual gamer, I fall neatly within his target audience."
Sapieha’s review came out the day before the official release of the game.
This informs my thought that his review was written to give the potential initial audiences an understanding of what they will get out of buying this game.
"Moreover, I can assume that he got an early copy of the game, hence his excitement in sharing such an overwhelmingly positive experience with those who are yet to play the game."
Sapieha applies a few directly and indirectly implied criteria by which he evaluates the quality of the game.
"Most prominently throughout his article, he highlights the value of the game's distilled message: respect the choices made by agents with the ability to choose."
"He holds on tightly to the motif of choice, initially introducing it as it relates to his own in-home smart speaker, then examining the importance of choice within the game as both a feature and as a storytelling tool, and finally he concludes by stating “that we need to be sure we’re listening so we can tell when” our technology gains intention ."
"By applying the game’s message as his own, he implies a profound respect for the philosophical depth of Quantic Dream’s flagship development and establishes this message as the central criteria that all other criteria must serve."
"
Sapieha also evaluated the quality of the game’s characters, narrative tools, player experience, and entertainment value of the game by their ability to serve the more meta aspects of the game."
"
Sapieha declares that he was “utterly enthralled by the three main characters” and their complexity complemented his playing experience by forcing him to “put great care into making the decisions that governed their actions” (par."
12).
"Through their eyes, he feels the injustice and oppression of this fictional world."
"Not only does this highlight their aptitude as agents pushing the narrative forward, but as engaging, complex, and almost human characters that he could relate to that inspire concern for how we will treat technology when its intelligence develops any comparable level of emotional sophistication."
"
While he does criticize the sometimes jagged storytelling that comes from inconsistencies between play-style and narrative, Sapieha generally praises the means by which the narrative advances what he understands to be its central purpose (par."
14).
He brings up images of “police shooting at unarmed suspects and protestors” and “refugees attempting to cross the border...
into Canada” to praise the connections to the real world as they serve to create a more relatable story for the players (par.
8).
"Moreover, he appreciates playing from the perspective of “personal appliances” in a grand “android revolution” as it forces the player to identify with the oppressed and perhaps reevaluate their own position as the oppressors in a thought provoking struggle for sentient technology’s freedom (par."
2).
"
He evaluates and heaps praise upon the more superficial but nonetheless important elements of the game including its innovative features, unmatched graphical detail, and its overall engagement."
Sapieha notes that players are given “a flowchart of our decisions after each chapter” and appreciates their ability to choose whether or not to use that chart to optimize their narrative as he validates those who do “work backwards and strive for the most positive outcome” (par.
13).
He also specifically praises Quantic Dream’s “performance capture technology” as it grants the agents of the game more degrees of freedom in expressing themselves which gives the androids a more human appeal and strengthens the game’s argument on behalf of the androids’ innate humanity (par.
9).
"Finally, he directly ranks the entertainment value on a binary scale asking whether it kept him “engaged and entertained.” “ …The answer was always a resounding yes” (Sapieha, par."
11).
"Each of the criteria that Sapieha applied in his evaluation, perhaps with the exception of the relative sophistication of the graphics technology, are at least somewhat subjective and could inspire many different conclusions for each criterion."
"For this game specifically, a reviewer might apply their own perspective on civil rights and the future of intelligent computing to determine the aptness of the game’s message; however, I think that would be an ill-willed attempt to apply a false voice to the subject."
"This game, and many other works like it, applies social commentary to its narrative."
To quantify that social commentary would require a benchmark.
"A benchmark that is, by its own nature, arbitrary and ideological."
"Instead, Sapieha seeks simply to respect the explicit message of the game - try not to be mean to sentient entities - and bases most of his criteria on their contribution in supporting this message."
"
Sapieha’s intentions for this article are many - to justify his excitement about the game, to inspire others to find their own excitement within the game, to argue on behalf of the games outward quality - but he adamantly pushes one purpose for this article: to emphasize the most central message of the game."
"That is, to question our domineering relationship with technology as it becomes more intelligent."
"Through his evaluation of the game, he consistently and successfully makes the case for sentient AIs’ rights and he does so powerfully by communicating in the language of those who care the most: tech and sci-fi nerds not unlike myself."
"Star Wars: A New Hope, the origin of a fictional galaxy more culturally impactful and narratively dense than anyone could have ever predicted, remains as timeless and entertaining as it ever was."
"It tows the fine line between whimsically grand, foolishly insightful, pleasantly poignant, and as it was described after its premiere, it's just “fun and funny” ."
"Inspired to create a modern mythology by the likes of Joseph Campbell, George Lucas has achieved his goal and simultaneously created a cinematic masterpiece that stands a head higher than its peers from Hollywood’s second golden age, beating out esteemed titles like Alien and Rocky at the very least in terms of its enduring relevance ."
"The plot itself is simple and, in many ways, familiar."
A rebellion has formed to combat the evil Empire that has seized control over the galaxy.
A princess is captured by this evil force and tormented by a maleficent sorcerer.
"A young man on a far away planet, our hero, hears the call to action of a damsel in distress and embarks on a journey to save her."
"Along the way, he learns more about himself taking several steps towards his great potential, and ultimately, our hero rescues the princess and leads the rebel forces to their greatest victory over the tyrants."
The wicked sorcerer is cast away to torment the galaxy another day.
"It's a tale as old as time, drawing from Arthurian mythology, and the many greek myths of father-son strife , yet in many ways, it adds a depth that can only be represented on screen."
Lucas begins his story with the capture and massacre of a rebel ship.
"Through a very direct use of color, scale, and costume we see a sterile, achromatic, faceless  imperial force commandeer a small rebel spaceship by forcibly docking them onto a comparably gargantuan battleship."
"With the aim of conveying a simple yet meaningful story, it is apparent that Lucas sacrifices any subtlety in favor of digestibility."
"Though in another film blatant and overt symbolism could at times become overbearing, the beautiful simplicity of the story Lucas is trying to tell ultimately pairs well with his conspicuous use of visual characterizations."
"
A story cannot shine without its characters, and the cast of A New Hope beams almost brighter than the story itself."
"In part due to the phenomenal portrayals by their actors and in part due to their relationships with the plot, every significant character, hero or villain, added to the emotional and thematic complexity of the film."
"As played by Alec Guinness, Obi Wan Kenobi, a wise old man and wielder of a universal power known as the Force, is the soul of the film."
He guides its moral compass with his abstract axioms and ensures that the viewer does not get lost in the spectacle on screen but sees the story’s more meaningful messages.
"Though mysterious and conservative with what he does and does not say, his presence implies a greater power in the Star Wars universe that gives the heroes a sense of a divine purpose."
"Luke Skywalker, played by Mark Hamill, makes for the perfect simple hero of a perfectly simple story."
"He’s young, innocent, and hopeful to a fault."
"Hamill superbly conveys the balance between naivety and heroism in his character especially through his tumultuous relationship with Harrison Ford’s character, Han Solo."
Han is our glimpse into the everyday humanoid of the Star Wars galaxy.
"Less focused on the conflict between good and evil, his character judges the moral questions that face him by how they do or do not affect his proverbial wallet."
"As a foil to Luke, Han diverges from Luke’s standard heroism in his lack of principles, arrogance, and jaded outlook."
"With undeniable charisma, Ford manages to bring out the cast's chemistry with his every scene, especially among the leading trio — Luke, Leia, and the snarky pilot himself."
"His humor, unlike that of today’s soulless Marvel formula, always seems to land without devaluing the impactful moments of the film."
"As Canby describes, Lucas  “is able to recall the tackiness of the old comic strips and serials he loves without making a movie that is, itself, tacky.” 
Princess Leia is far from your typical damsel in distress."
Carry Fisher plays her with a striking stoicism.
"As a powerful political advocate for freedom, Leia is comfortable under duress and she displays the capability to be insolent in the face of great torment and coercion."
"To the viewer, she represents the rebellion’s steadfast opposition to tyranny with great pride and to great effect."
"The iconic and terrifying Darth Vader makes an unforgettable impression on the viewer from the first time we hear the ominous breath of James Earl Jones, Vader’s voice-actor in the film."
"Though he is shown to be commanding and imposing in many scenes, I could not help but feel a little underwhelmed with his intimidation factor in this film."
His power is often overcome and we never see the extent of his hatred represented in its entirety.
"The android comic relief duo of C3PO, a golden humanoid service-bot, and R2-D2, a cylindrical, dalek shaped unit without the capability of biological language, described by contemporary reviewers as “the year's best new comedy team,” provide a unique representation of a potential robot human relationship ."
"Treated as second class citizens of the galaxy by almost every lifeform , robots are portrayed as both benevolent and subservient."
"Since Lucas gives them agency and their own personalities, the presence of R2 and C3PO conjures in the viewer’s mind many questions of the ethical treatment of sentient machines and allows for a character’s relationship to androids to define their moral integrity."
"
Apart from its characters, the film managed to dazzle with many of the original special effects that hold up even to the standards of today, and rightly so."
"As said by a reviewer in 1999 in a way that maintains its validity, A New Hope “focused the industry on big-budget special-effects blockbusters, blasting off a trend we are still living through” ."
"As the origin of the now commonplace action packed cinematic spectacle it is only natural that the immense imposing imperial battleships are still menacing, the robots are still convincing, the sets are as immersive as ever, and space appears as vast and awe-inspiring as it does in modern films."
"Unfortunately, since I watched the remastered edition, I could feel the age of 1990’s CGI."
"Though contemporary critics considered the additions to be “well done”, given the huge improvements we’ve seen to CGI technology the attempts to subtly insert new alien creatures appear consistently uncanny and out of place, briefly stripping away the immersion that the film had thus far worked so diligently to create ."
One scene with a CGI Jabba the Hutt added in post-production was discernibly awkward especially as Han’s body glitched up and down around Jabba’s ill-constructed tail.
"Notably, at the end of that scene Han exited wishing the slug-like creature goodbye by saying “Jabba, you’re a wonderful human being.” Perhaps it was a sarcastic jab at the Hut, but the poor handling of Jabba’s CGI introduction made it appear to be more of a clumsy editing mistake."
"
Even against the surprisingly good original special effects and the potent chemistry between the cast, it is the work of the movie’s composer, John Williams, that defines the greatness of this film."
"Without overshadowing what we see on screen, Williams single-handedly controls how the viewer experiences the film."
"In the film’s final battle against the Death Star, Williams quietly but effectively manipulates the movie’s theme song to at first build anticipation, then create a sense of ominous concern, and then throughout the fight, to highlight each moment of its emotional rollercoaster."
"When an enemy fighter ship tailing Luke’s X-wing gets shot down by one of the other rebel fighters, rather than allow us some brief relief, Williams switches to a more urgent and stressful melody so as to say that the fight has only just begun."
"In every moment, Williams has control over the audience's emotions, adding an immeasurable layer of emotional depth to the impact of the film."
"While William’s control of the film's pathos is exemplary, the way in which he represents and ultimately defines many of Lucas’s core themes is perhaps even more impressive."
"Hope, duty, innocence, good, and evil are all given their own melodies, each more magnificent than the last."
"Moreover, he manipulates, mixes, and matches these themes so effortlessly that they can be used to evoke many feelings in the listener, often at the same time."
"
Two scenes in particular stand out for their profound musicality and their iconic melodies, respectively."
The first sees Luke bathed in the oranges and reds looking towards two suns setting over the desert planet’s horizon.
"Paired with the aesthetic beauty of this binary sunset, a horn plays timidly gradually approaching a crescendo as Luke approaches his perch then, as if heralded in by the Force itself, the eruption of a string orchestra passionately plays a grand and bittersweet rendition Williams’s melody for duty creating an awe-inspiring moment representing Luke’s decision to answer his call to action."
"The second occurs not long after the first when Luke and Obi-Wan Kenobi enter a rough bar in Mos Eisley, a space port where, according to Obi-Wan, “you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.” Upon entering, we are shown a menagerie of aliens from the serpentine to the vaguely werewolf, all with a dangerous gleam of violent volatility in their eyes."
"To accompany such a scene of “scum and villainy,” Williams presents us with what has since become one of his most iconic works, an infectious swing jazz tune played expertly by a band of bobbing aliens with bulbous white heads."
"This scene speaks not only to the expertise of Williams as a composer, but in the canon, to the cultural depth of the galaxy Lucas has constructed."
"This first installment in the Star Wars saga flows fluidly through its plot, allowing us to breathe in its most impactful developments."
"That is, until the transition between the penultimate and the ultimate act of the film."
"In introducing the characters, the galaxy, and the dynamism of its inhabitants, Lucas seems to fit every necessary and substantial detail comfortably into the opening forty minutes or so."
"After we have met every character and established their motivations, the plot points begin to unfold in a cohesive and satisfying manner."
"However, in the final thirty minutes we are left gasping for air as the plot rushes to its finale."
"After the film’s goal, as dictated at the start of the movie, has been accomplished and it feels as though we have reached its climax, Lucas insists on drawing it out to a more grand conclusion."
Luke transitions from our young and inexperienced hero to battle-ready soldier in a matter of minutes and characters we meet only briefly are killed off just moments later giving what should be meaningful sacrifices a sense of insignificance.
"Though Lucas’s grand finale was well worth the haste , I only wish he did not have to artificially accelerate the film’s pacing to get there."
" 
To no fault of its own, Star Wars: Episode IV suffers somewhat from the inconsistencies  made through the decisions of future movies."
Most glaring is the incestuous implications of romantic tension between Luke and Leia who are in future films revealed not only to be siblings but twins.
"Moreover, Obi-Wan should recognize R2-D2 and C3PO from the prequel trilogy and the more recent Obi-Wan Kenobi series somewhat contradicts the relationship between Leia and the titular jedi we see in A New Hope and has many other noticeable consequences with regard to the consistency of several of Guinness’s lines."
"To fault the film itself, Obi Wan references the aptitude of imperial stormtroopers with a blaster only for every one of their many blasts to miss the main characters horrendously."
"Perhaps this is nitpicky, but their aim is so bad that what should be a serious line reads, in retrospect, as comedic."
Star Wars: Episode IV was the genesis of a new generation of films and the origin of what is now a prolific and monumental franchise.
"More than anything, this film is an embodiment of the titular theme — hope."
"In this tale from a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, I can only wish that future viewers for years to come derive from this film, as I did, an enduring sense of that nagging and unwavering feeling."
The dream of an infinite potential for good to conquer evil; the dream of a future that is better than today; the dream that there will always be A New Hope.
  
"The introduction to Anahid Kassabian’s Ubiquitous Listening: Affect, Attention, and Distributed Subjectivity explores the titular subject to great depths."
"More specifically, she explores the idea that listening to ubiquitous musics, whether they are given or denied attention, influences some affective response in the human mind and body that functions to close the gaps in a “non-individual, not simply human, distributed subjectivity” ."
The introduction to Pauline Oliveros’s Deep Listening: A Composer’s Sound Practice presents a meditative practice of fully attentive listening as a means of expanding the potential for aural perception “to the whole of the space/time continuum of perceptible sound” .
"Quite obviously from their titles, these texts evaluate similar yet in many ways contradictory subjects."
"It should be noted that since Oliveros is describing a practice while Kassabian describes a previously unexplored realm of academia, their many points of consensus and discord should not be seen as an evaluation of two conflicting approaches to listening, rather their similarities and differences enlighten how each text defines humanity’s relationship to sounds and musics."
"Structurally, both Oliveros and Kassabian employ definitions as a means to develop their subjects though they differ in their choice of sources and in the tones they create."
"Outside of their rhetorical strategies, they differ in how they draw the line between listening and hearing and in the mode by which listening and hearing occurs."
"While Oliveros might describe sound as an art of attention, Kassabian would describe it as an art of erotics."
"Despite their differences, they find common ground in how sound expands the mind and in how sound impacts the listener."
"In this way, the texts in combination illustrate the value of aural arts, natural and man-made, in defining the human experience individually and at a societal scale."
"Likely due to the fact that each work functions to introduce their respective subjects in their respective books, the two pieces share similar structures and rhetorical strategies with some key differences in their execution."
"Notably, each work is intended to introduce and define key terms and establish how those key terms relate to each other in their subjects."
"Kassabian, for instance, uses headers that describe the term to be defined or the relationship to be explored."
"One section bears the title “Affect,” the next “Senses,” and after each of those comes “Affect and Senses'' ."
"Though terms and their relationships are defined in these sections, Kassabian uses them primarily to express the nuances of his thesis in this case he uses their relationship to present senses as “a not rigidly differentiated field” that is closely intertwined with emotional and haptic affects ."
"Similarly, Oliveros divides her introduction into sections, but rather than using headers, she relies on rhetorical questions and bold faced sentences to establish structure."
"Each of her sections have a similar purpose to Kassabians in that they define a term, but more importantly, they add depth to the understanding of her subject."
"For example, there are two consecutive sections, each introduced by the question, “So what is consciousness?” ."
"The first establishes a lower level conception of what consciousness is and how it works, the second describes consciousness in the context of a previous statement about listening so as to qualify and expand upon the necessary conditions for Deep Listening."
Both of these sections function to develop a deeper understanding of the complexities of Deep Listening.
"Moreover, both pieces lean on academia to support their conclusions though often through different means."
"Kassabian uses cultural sources and academia around music, film, and sound to provide some nuance to the intellectual topics he approaches, often drawing insight from them or countering their conclusions to support his own."
"In one case, Kassabian refers to Joseph Lanza’s Elevator Music to establish that “ubiquitous musics… are a quintessentially twentieth-century technology” ."
"In another, he expands on Deleuze and Guattari’s conception of Striated and Smooth space to determine that haptics are “closely tied to erotics, to the dissolution of boundaries, to an erosion of self-other distinctions” ."
"Oliveros, on the other hand, uses a range of scientific and cultural works to establish her definitions."
"One scientific source that described how “evoked potentials in the brain appear up to a half-second before the individual is aware of a stimulus” is used to further her point that since “perception in time is an illusion,” consciousness is the act of bringing the past to the present and therefore is inextricably linked with “self-recognition” ."
Tonally Deep Listening and Ubiquitous Listening apply very different approaches as their intended audiences come from very different backgrounds.
Throughout Ubiquitous Listening Kassabian uses an intensely academic tone.
"That is, his writing is heavily relational and almost esoteric."
"This is perhaps best exemplified by one of his sentences referring to the works of Deleuze and Guattari as they relate to that of Marks and Massumi where he states that “The shift away from narrative identification and position draws a renewed focus onto somatic, haptic engagements with music ” ."
This sentence draws on several of his previously explored ideas and utilizes academic terms specific to his subject because his audience is assumed to be of an academic background.
"In contrast, Oliveros is writing to advocate for the public to accept and engage in the practice of Deep Listening in the hopes that they may attend one of her workshops and further their understanding of sound and listening."
"Therefore, much of her writing is more simple, direct, and concise."
"Apart from their rhetoric, Kassabian and Oliveros find many points of conflict and disagreement in their content."
"Firstly, their most obvious point of contention is around the difference  between listening and hearing."
"Fundamentally, their views are opposed on this front as both suggest that listening develops the conception of a self, but they disagree on what that self may consist of and what type of listening, attentive or otherwise, can serve this function."
Kassabian establishes that listening consists of “a range of engagements between and across human bodies and music technologies” and therefore his definition “wipes out… the routine distinction between listening and hearing… in which the presumption is that hearing is physiological and listening is conscious and attentive” .
Oliveros describes the difference between listening and hearing in just the way that Kassabian “wipes out” by stating that she differentiates “‘to hear’ and ‘to listen’.
To hear is the physical means that enables perception.
To listen is to give attention to what is perceived both acoustically and psychologically” .
Kassabian determines that listening can imply any degree of attention while Oliveros draws a hard line between listening with attention and hearing without it.
"In drawing that line, she discards the value of hearing to “self-recognition” as hearing lacks the key feature of consciousness."
Kassabian counter’s this point by establishing that “Identity is a position left behind by the work of affect” which is unrelated to the degree of consciousness.
"As a result of their separate approaches to listening, deep versus ubiquitous, they find themselves again in opposition to each other with respect to the mode of listening."
Kassabian again takes the more holistic stance by suggesting that listening is not dependent on the ear; it is rather dependent on the sum of a number of sensory experiences.
"That is, he thinks of hearing “as a not rigidly differentiated field” ."
"This allows him to come to the conclusion that all things, hearing or deaf, are bound by ubiquitous listening in a distributed subjectivity."
"Oliveros, however, clearly states that “The ear makes it possible to hear and to listen” ."
Her point is made as a result of the fundamental difference between the purposes of Ubiquitous and Deep Listening.
"Since Deep Listening is intended to expand perception rather than expanding the self, it is dependent on the ability to perceive sound aurally."
"
In spite of their differences, Kassabian and Oliveros both determine that their respective ways of hearing expand the mind beyond its previous ability."
"To this end, they agree that perception is influenced by the perceiver's thoughts and experiences — thoughts and experiences that are often a part of a shared subjectivity."
"In defining listening, Oliveros determines that “Sound pressure patterns assist hearing but cultural history and experience influences listening” ."
"Kassabian extends this argument and states that we should “stop analyzing music as an object external to us” rather there is a “large field of subjectivity, neither undifferentiated nor individualized, neither simply individual nor reductively social” that connects us to what we hear ."
"As Jonathan Williger contends in his review of Deep Listening the album, Oliveros similarly advocates for deep listening as a means to connect with the “many vibrational energies throughout the universe.” That is, “To listen is to be aware of one’s self in that collective whole” ."
"Though they may disagree on the modality of listening, they find common ground in its impact to all parts of the body and mind."
"In the practice of Deep Listening, Oliveros emphasizes the importance of “listening to my listening and discerning the effects on my body-mind continuum” ."
"Through Ubiquitous Listening, Kassabian states that there is some affect on the “circuit of bodily responses to stimuli that take place before conscious apprehension” that leaves a residue which “accretes in our bodies, becoming the stuff of future affective responses” ."
"In each case, the authors agree that there is some relationship between sound, body, and mind that alters one’s perception indefinitely."
" 
In combination, Ubiquitous Listening and Deep Listening each present unique opportunities to learn from the sounds and musics we ingest every day."
"As humans, we are surrounded by information that is constantly shifting and developing our identities, but if we take the time to listen — to truly and deeply listen — we can see in the noise of that information who we really are and we can use what we see  to expand our understanding of ourselves as we relate to the greater distributed subjectivity."
"As I understand it, I think of my memory as similar to a data structure called a hashmap."
"That is, when accessing memories, they cannot simply be indexed from 0 , but I need to have a key that points to a reference that stores that memory."
"In many cases, that key is sensual."
"For example, the smell of cigarettes might allow me to more vividly remember when my family and I bought our dog since the breeder’s house was stained with the scent."
"Despite this fact, the memory that my mind associates with the key “my first memory” is of a young, likely three or four year-old, me, having just gotten up from watching Dora and walking towards the door of my family’s first house after being called by my mom."
"Much of this memory is visual and reasoned since the key I have is a linguistic one, but I do remember a feeling of excitement as it may have been the first time I got to see my mom that day."
I can hardly ever remember my dreams unless I quickly make an effort to retain them after waking up.
Writing or dictating my dreams immediately after waking up often allows me to remember more of the dream than I otherwise would have.
"When I do this, I can usually work backwards from where the dream ends by analyzing what got me to that point."
This technique comes with the caveat that whatever series of events that I string together will be a low fidelity representation of the dream.
The only time I truly remember my dreams is within the dream itself or within subsequent dreams that may take place as a continuation of that previous dream.
I have what I would consider to be a rational fear of the dark because of its ability to obscure and conceal potential dangers.
"I find that I am often drawn to paintings that evoke this fear, namely Francisco de Goya’s Pinturas Negras ."
Fear heightens the senses.
"It makes us more keenly aware of the details in a painting, or in the case of darker paintings, it makes us project detail that is obscured."
Fear is a flow state and like any other it inspires creativity.
But creativity born from fear often tends toward the negative which I think appeals to me as much of my creative thought on the day-to-day is born from optimism and therefore my mind yearns for a balance.
A common theme I noticed throughout these readings was the incredible faith that libertarians have for markets to function as both a moral technology and economic power house.
"By extension, there was also a theme of disdain for the over-reaching of governments ."
"To the libertarian, government, as Rothbard expounds upon, is the root of most if not all of the economic problems we face as a society."
"The solution to those problems, therefore, is to establish freed markets in place of inefficient government bureaucracies."
"
I found the way in which libertarians argued around the issue of inequality to be very interesting and almost counterintuitive to the notions I had previously accepted about capitalism."
"Specifically, the Rawlsian concept that it is better to divide up the pie unequally and make a bigger pie than to divide up a smaller pie equally and Chartier’s suggestion that Markets Undermine Privilege challenge what I think to be the traditional idea that capitalism  enshrines inequality and therefore leaves the 90% worse off."
"Johnson engages with this dichotomy head on arguing that capitalism  is the root of such inequalities and therefore the traditional notion holds some water, though only in the case of the statist-allied definition of capitalism."
I am curious to see empirically whether Chartier’s theory of MUP actually applies across the board in the places where government intervention has been entrenched as a societal norm like K-12 education.
Kirk’s laundry list of conservative principles outlines reasonably well a trend I saw across writings from conservative authors.
"That is, these authors tend towards a value system based on a strong sense of morality derived from traditional  and/or religious values, a belief that deviation from the current societal structure can be unstable and dangerous , a desire to limit and regulate central powers, and a will to maintain all rights especially that of property."
"The question of how we as a society should reconcile morality and religious values with the maintenance of capitalism  is explored at length by Kristol, Optiz, Rand, Hayek in his article “The Moral Element of Free Enterprise”, and to some extent, D’Souza."
"All of whom conclude that capitalism and freedom require its constituents to agree on some idea of morality, and though there is some dissension of what that morality would be in the ideal, most of them agree that something is better than nothing."
"Rand and Kristol both find that conservatism, as it stood when they wrote their respective articles, fails to offer any answer as to what this morality should be and therefore it is sowing the seeds of its own demise to more persuasive and less practical ideologies that do offer a moral framework."
"Communism is, as written about by Optiz, innately opposed to conservatism because it denies the existence of the spiritual and seeks to, through revolutionary action, undo the gains made by values derived from the bible and the classical era."
The Heritage Foundation’s list of conservative principles is an especially good example of the conservative’s healthy distrust of central government power as several of its points are based on the idea that individual rights should supersede government control and government control should be limited by the constitution and ideally deferred to local governments before federal.
"I’m drawn to this One Republic song almost entirely because of its use in Top Gun: Maverick, although the way in which it emanates positivity and a sense of nostalgia for summers past influences my attraction to it."
I think any song that I crave to listen to has some connection to a feeling that I am seeking.
"Whether it be a song that represents a calm and warm day spent doing only what I wish to do and nothing more, a song that represents the love of Christmas with family, or a song that represents a good night out."
"That sense of representation can either come from a direct association with the context in which I heard a song the first time or first few times, or it can come from the general vibe of the song if it is constructed well enough."
I think many people connect with music in this way.
"That is, many people are drawn to songs by their ‘vibe.’ If a song resonates with a person’s life experience then that person will enjoy that song
The value of negative criticism can not be seen immediately."
Negative criticism in the few moments after it is released can only serve to make an experience more negative for both the audience and the creator.
Negative criticism derives its value from its capability to improve future art.
"If someone creates a work that is poorly received, the negative criticism they face will inspire them to make slight alterations to their process which may therefore make their next work better."
"If it doesn’t, they can continue to iterate through this process of creation and criticism until it does."
"For fifteen minutes, I sat at my desk in my dorm and listened."
"I listened to the whir of the AC unit, blowing lightly but with a comforting consistency."
"Never faltering, never sputtering, just whirring like a never ending gust of wind."
Then my refrigerator begins to buzz.
Like the buzzing of a mechanical beehive.
"Two tones, a whir and buzz, matching each other in their persistence, creating one unified and beautiful tone."
Then the fan turns on in the hallway.
"A new frequency, but a welcome one."
"It matches the other two, and without ego, it joins them in song."
"
Soon the buzz of the refrigerator dies down, but its song still lingers in my ear."
"It's as though I can still, I hear its part in the trio, but it's no longer substantial."
"Some phenomenon of the mind has maintained its buzz, as though I am trying to hold on to the memory of the harmony it once made."
The fan outside soon turns itself off and I am left with just the whir of my AC unit.
It feels lonely.
Wanting for its partners.
"But they have given up, and will not rejoin it for some time."
I notice chatter outside but it is muffled by the walls into vague and rhythmic hums.
"
The AC unit turns on, now bellowing angrily."
Its noise demands all attention.
It covers its competitors and tries to blow them away.
"Then there is a click, as the motor quickly repents for its outburst and returns to a gentle whir."
"For a moment, though there is no hope of silence, there is at least peace."
Everything is as it should be.
"
But more voices disturb the stability."
I hear and feel a flurry of movement at the end of the hall.
Steps.
"No, stomps reverberate so deeply and shake my room so fully that they might well have come from my own feet."
"In my fifteen minutes, I noticed that there is not much variation in the sounds of my dorm."
"Whirs, buzzes, muffled voices, and the occasional bout of movement, but not much exceeding those."
"I noticed that there is rarely stability, but the instability is always predictable."
"The loudest noises come from within my room, particularly when the AC unit turns its fan on."
The softest audible noises come from the AC units outside of my room.
"I was surprised to see the wide range of how each religion can be interpreted as either morally justifying, and in the case of Christianity fundamental to, capitalism or it can be interpreted as antithetical to capitalism rejecting almost every feature of its morality."
"For Christianity, evidence of the former can be found in the reading about The Protestant Ethic and in Micheal Novak’s response to the question “Has capitalism become incompatible with christianity?’ Evidence of the latter is Pope Francis’s comments about markets and inequality and Salsman's essay about the Christianity and the welfare state."
"My personal belief after these readings is that Catholicism appears to be diametrically opposed to the morality of capitalism in almost every respect whereas Protestantism, specifically Puritanism, has at least some moral justifications for capitalism as a vehicle to promote work ethic, asceticism, and success, as said by Weber, and in my opinion, to promote integrity and honesty."
"Ultimately, I believe that Christianity’s internal conflict with the capitalist system that creates so much wealth and yet so much inequality has, as argued by Salsman, led to a middle ground for many Christians politically to support some form of a welfare state."
"I know very little about Islam and sharia law so, after the readings, I was surprised to find that at least Sorman contends that Islam is morally accepting of many foundational facets of capitalism like entrepreneurship and seeking wealth without guilt."
"The restrictions on joint-stock companies, the dispersion of inheritance, and the prohibition of interest seem to me to be no more serious hampers on capitalism than the laws and morality dictated by Christianity."
" It makes sense, therefore, that Sorman blames the shoddy state of capitalism on tyrannical and unstable governments established after decolonization more so than sharia law."
"As someone who is generally optimistic about capitalism, I am inclined to believe that capitalism and the environment are not fundamentally opposed to each other."
"However, it is hard to ignore the impact that humans have had on the climate simply by virtue of the energy and resources required to fuel innovation and increasing standards of living and arguments such as Schwartz’s and Foster’s seem to establish an inherent conflict between natural interests and human interests."
"From a simply human-centric perspective, Epstein and Shellenberger make convincing arguments that we will be able to withstand and adapt to changes in the environment as they come, whether they are caused by us or otherwise."
"However, human life is not my only concern as it relates to the environment."
"I think, contrary to some of the readings, that maintaining the beauty of the natural world is equally as important as maintaining and improving human life."
"While I do agree with Epstien’s assertion that we will find better, cleaner, and cheaper ways to fuel our economic growth, I must also admit that we, as a species, have wrought much ecological damage already seeking that ever present goal and because of this fact I believe that there should be bounds in place to restrain the negative externalities of capitalist fervor."
"Calls to violently overthrow capitalism so as to mitigate its environmental harm seem, to me, short sighted at best and self-contradictory at worst."
"As Schwartz asserts in his article, “Man survives only by altering nature to satisfy his own needs.” I don’t believe this will change simply by virtue of a new economic system."
A communist government would chop down the Amazon rainforest for more collectivized cattle farms as easily as a capitalist economy would chop it down for private ones.
"Moreover, revolutionary socialists like Street seem to ignore the potential for massive environmental damage that a violent revolution may incur despite many criticisms of the environmental harm done by imperialist wars."
"Ultimately, I reject the idea that an inclination towards capitalism and a desire to maintain the earth's ecology are fundamentally at odds as capitalism has the potential for infinite recursive improvements upon itself that leave open the possibility for more sustainable and more efficient energy, resource attainment, and agricultural practices."
"Before those changes revolutionize our world, however, I think it necessary to ensure that our most valuable ecosystems are protected and, unfortunately, the only entities with the resources to ensure that protection are governments."
"In one of my classes last semester, a phrase said by Ruth Wilson Gilmore has really nagged at me as I consider myself generally pro-free-market but also anti-racist."
"In a video entitled, “Geographies of Racial Capitalism,” Gilmore asserted that “Capitalism requires inequality and racism enshrines it.” Taken separately, I don’t think either of these claims are particularly objectionable but together I think the implication that capitalism therefore enshrines racism certainly, at least to some degree, is."
"We have seen capitalism, essentially defined by Kendi as the freedom to exploit those with less money than you, perpetuate some form of societal racial discrimination essentially since its conception and especially so in America against black people."
"If that is truly what capitalism is, I think I would have to be forced to agree with Gilmore."
"However, other definitions of capitalism challenge this notion."
"The ‘crony capitalism’ that people like Dixon criticize, I argue, is the sort of capitalism that Gilmore and Kendi despise, and rightly so."
"Many pro-capitalist thinkers also hold this breed of capitalism in contempt, but I think their solutions may hold more water when it comes to being ‘anti-racist.’ Riesman makes the simple yet compelling argument that capitalism, as defined by a system of free markets protected by a limited government, is inherently opposed to discrimination and differentiation on the basis of anything other than an individual’s productivity since that's all markets will care about."
"Though I agree with Kendi’s suggestions to improve poverty via a universal social safety net and advocate for a “progressive capitalism,” I do not think any of his proposed policies will make any progress in solving racism."
They may improve the lives of those who live in dire situations but they will not break down systemic inequalities hardened by many years of traditional thinking.
"As Ann Cudd argues, only capitalism can do that."
"The 1981 World Bank Report argues for growth oriented policies in the agricultural sector like the privatization of farms, reforming price controls on agricultural goods, and investment in agricultural research of Sub-Saharan Africa."
Many if not all of their solutions involve greater privatization and less government interventions.
Anecdotal and statistical data from throughout the African continent is presented to support these capitalist reforms with the apparent hope that they will inspire some development in the industry.

Bamako explores how ex-colonial powers have held down and stolen from Africa even in the post-colonial era."
"Similar to Kauonui’s argument about settler colonialism, neo-colonialism in Africa is shown to be a structure maintained by Western powers."
"While the structure of neo-colonialism in post-colonial Africa is not intended towards genocide, it has, similar to settler colonialism, functioned as a tool for the exploitation of their land."
"
Before watching Bamako and before Monday’s lecture, I held the misconception that much if not all of Africa’s economic falters resulted simply from corruption and ineffective governance after decolonization destabilized the continent."
"While these factors may have played a role in this, I was unaware of the West’s imposition of structural adjustment and the significant part it had in much of Africa’s suffering."
Hickey believes that art is intrinsically without value but can derive value from the sum of public opinion and interpretation surrounding it .
Tarkovsky similarly believes that art derives its purpose and therefore its value from the consumer .
Hickey establishes that he believes that the art world defines the value of art.
"In doing so, it “conducts an ongoing referendum on how things should look and the way we should look at things” ."
"Tarkovsky expresses a similar idea, in that art defines its value through its ability to “explain to the artist himself and to those around him what man lives for, what is the meaning of his existence” ."
The two are alike in their thought that art finds its worth through its capability to reflect and represent the human experience.
The key difference between them is that Tarkovsky gives agency to the art itself as it defines its own value and Hickey removes that agency and instead ascribes it solely to the audience.
Each of the reviewer’s expectations were defined by the greatness of the previous movie.
"They both acknowledged how the previous movie maintained a strong narrative even in moments where it may have also been doing service to the Marvel franchise, a characteristic both reviewers feel the new Black Panther movie could not replicate."
"Moreover, they both touch on how the script at times could limit the actors performances more so than it did in the previous film."
"Ultimately, they come to similar conclusions with regard to their criteria based on the original Black Panther film: this movie was a faithful sequel but a flawed one at that."
Both the Little White Lies article and the New Yorker article assume their reader has some knowledge of superhero movies and the Marvel franchise specifically.
Bunsie mentions the term “Phase 4” a term specific to the MCU that only Marvel fans/viewers would recognize and  Brody that the reader has at least seen the first Black Panther film as much of his evaluation is based on it.
These reviews use the bare minimum of description in their evaluation introducing only the initial characters and their initial relationship to each other.
Many of their evaluations do not criticize specific moments in the plot or developments in any of the characters  rather they tend to evaluate thematic successes and failures.
The New Yorker ventures into the realm of evaluating developments but only with the movie's introductory events and nothing beyond that.
Each of the reviews show just enough of the story to get their reader thinking about what certain plot points may mean but not enough to reveal the story at large as they generally only reveal the bare minimum necessary for their evaluation.
Okihiro argues that the black power movement in the US emerged as a consequence of the Third World liberation movements and the discourse around anti-colonialism .
"Moreover, he asserts that the Third World liberation movement has roots in racialized politics which made its impact on black power all the more relevant ."
He points to the Black Panthers as they considered the US government to be a colonizing force and African Americans as colonial subjects .
"As Cesaire speaks on the decivilizing force of colonization and refers to Nazism as an extension of colonialism, Moyn describes the Western human rights movement as a reaction to World War II ."
"Therefore, as Cesaire might argue, human rights was a reaction to colonialism and the movement occured because of Nazism's relationship to colonialism."
"Though I have read much about domestic politics in modern Chinese history, I never associated the rise of China under Mao with the global collective liberation movement in the post-WWII era."

Berger refers to a ‘language of images’ as the use of art and other visuals as a form of or supplement to communication."
Images - like words - have no authority of their own but form a powerful force for expression when used as a language.
"Today, that language of images is most accurately embodied in memes."
"The culture around memes, today, sways public discourse and has become an essential tool in the expression of public sentiment."
"I, like most of us who exist in the presence of social media, have become as literate as one can try to be in memes, but their transience makes complete literacy an impossibility."
Memes and other images surround us on the Internet and often make their way into day to day conversations over text.
Literacy in the ‘language of images’ can skew how we interpret art of the past if we approach that art as language.
It can reduce art to a message.
A means to end in communication.
But I try to avoid assigning meanings to works of art from both the past and present.
There is a sharp distinction between art and images of language.
"Though one can at times be the other, art conveys an experience - images of language convey a meaning."
"The field of modern economics, developed to model the activities of a capitalist system, assumes that all participants in a market are rational."
"I think it would be far-fetched to say that all people in capitalist systems always behave rationally and with their own self-interest in mind, but capitalism and economics developed a system of reason that gives each of its participants a guide to act in a ‘reasonable’ manner that is promoted via self interest."
Therefore there is at least some defensible claim to say that capitalism is a “system of the mind” as it establishes a doctrine to describe reason .
"As Galbraith describes it, capitalism is a way to effectively decentralize economic decision making on a large scale."
"As its success relies on its distributions of actors striving to find economic success through its system of reason, I think it is fair to call this a system of the head since it requires and promotes the activity of many brains thinking and acting within reason and with ingenuity."
"Most historians seem to agree that capitalism, if not natural in itself, is rooted in human nature, particularly in the realms of desire for acquisition of wealth, competition, and the pursuit of happiness."
"Some may feel that these inclinations are solely self-serving and therefore dangerous to promote in the human condition, others that these inclinations are paramount to the fulfilling our desire for self-actualization, and others still may argue that the economic actions taken within capitalism are not grounded in morality but are instead grounded in reason so they should not be included in one's moral evaluation of oneself."
"For the most part , elements of humanism emerge from both pro-capitalists and anti-capitalists."
Pro-capitalists often seem to be of the opinion that capitalism improves the average living standard over time so therefore it is a positive system.
Anti-capitalist often seem to be of the opinion that capitalism is a blight on the working people as it enshrines their exploitation.
"Anti-humanism too, is a feature of each camp’s ideology."
That is  pro-capitalists believe in exploitation for the purpose of beating the competition and  anti-capitalists hold much disdain for the individuality that capitalism allows in its constituents.
"
One of the most interesting ideas I found in these readings was the concept that we may no longer live in a capitalist America."
Not only as a result of increasing government intervention but also as a result of markets developing away from the structures and cycles prescribed by Marx.
"Rather, as Sombart, Smith and Fulcher describe, we live in an epoch of late capitalism characterized by the spread of industrialization around the world and the increasing expansion of financial capitalism and enterprises, like Apple, that are no longer industrial and cannot be classified by the traditional Marxist definition of capitalist enterprises."
"Despite these changes from its original classification, however, I think capitalism still has the spirit of ‘economic individualism,’ though this economic individualism is now extended to ventures that are not focused on hard capital."
"
"
"Packer, Rand, Buchanan and Mises all seem to agree that capitalism is a system built for the independent minded, the self-assured, and the rugged individualist."
"To be certain, these characteristics are commonly seen amongst those who do succeed within capitalism and therefore there is some argument to be made that these characteristics are promoted within capitalism."
"Moreover, as Packer illustrates in her speech, the prerequisites to success within capitalism are also pre-requisites to lasting happiness."
"I would argue, along with Rand, that key similarity between all of these features as they relate to capitalism is their connection to self-interest."
"
Self-interest is the primary motive for economic reason within capitalism and that has had many downstream effects on the psychology of its constituents."
"Self-interest takes many forms – social, financial, material, psychological, spiritual, etc."
"– and often, if it does not harm or exploit others, a beneficial motivator for an individual."
Self-interest precipitates self-responsibility which allows people to derive greater and more meaningful satisfaction from the lives they live.
"However, to structure a society entirely around self-interest can lead to social isolation, failures to attend to dire situations which do not directly benefit the attender, and systemic distortions of what is truly in one's own self-interest ."
Buchanan believes that any desire for distributionist socialism is derived from an insecurity of one’s own ability to take responsibility for themselves.
"I would argue, on the contrary, that distributionist leanings often seek to address the negative externalities of a system designed entirely around self-interest as well as to offset some of its more negative psychological consequences."
"
Capitalistic self-interest promotes some of the psychological prerequisites for happiness, but it can also penalize other necessities for happiness like family time, leisure, and community among those rugged individualists who do not have the good grace of enough wealth to slow down for a moment."
"As we saw in Sandel’s article, there are some parts of the human experience that are not amenable to the free market and these can and will be eroded under capitalism if and when markets are given the chance to find their way into them."

Cesaire asserts that the process of colonization functions not only to dehumanize the colonized but to decivilize the colonizer.
This includes but is not limited to all of the people who profit from or indulge in the profits of colonialism.
"He points to Nazism as a natural extension of the colonial system since the utter brutality of the Nazis within Europe could only have developed in a culture that accepts, and in some cases advocates for, such terrible brutality outside of Europe."
"
As ""Imagined Communities"" explores the foundations of a nation, Williams and Chrisman explore how the very conception of a colonial nation erases the culture of the natives that were displaced."
"Not only does it destroy native culture, but in impressing upon the natives the process of developing a nation’s consciousness, colonizers will reinforce ideas of racialized cultures so as to confuse any cohesive justifications for the native people's nationhood."
"While Cesaire introduced to me the concept of decivilization as an externality of colonialism, it was not until I saw the scenes of colonial violence and its consequences in Concerning Violence that I realized the raw truth of this statement."
"In this film, we see colonizers who twist their minds to morally justify colonialism and we see freedom fighters pushed to brutality."
"I had known that colonialism decivilized the colonizer, but I had never thought that it functioned to decivilize the native as well."
"Lee argues that the Fu Manchu mustache functioned synecdochally to represent many misconceptions about the Chinese and, more broadly, Southeast Asians most prominently representing the threat of the 'yellow peril' to white civilization."
"Dating back to Early Modern European plays, Asia was often cast as a terrible, invading force from the East ."
"When the mandarin mustache replaced turbans and scimars to indicate anything Oriental, it similarly became associated with the menacing characters that often were themselves representative of the threat of Asia ."
"Building on the perspective of Dunbar-Ortiz, Said expands on America's identity as a settler colonial nation by highlighting its expansionary colonial tendencies."
"The war in Iraq, for example, used similar justifications for foreign intervention as colonial powers did in their invasions of Africa and the Americas ."
"America, however, subtly but distinctly frames its actions as 'the spread of democracy' rather than 'the spread of modernity’
In Lee’s presentation, there was a brief mention of the ‘fox eye’ as a trend in makeup derived from the natural features of Southeast Asians."
"I have seen this style before on celebrities and amongst internet star’s, most if not all of them white, but I did not connect it to the Asian eye it quite obviously seeks to imitate."
"This, along with several other examples, forced me to reevaluate the extent to which Asian culture is appropriated and misused even today."

"As of now, I support capitalism over any other form of societal governance, but acknowledging its many blind spots, I am in favor of a more mixed system that can address the failure cases of capitalism."
"Capitalism is an endlessly turning wheel that drives us each day towards greater technological advancements increasing the standard of living for everyone, regardless of class, at an exponential rate."
Capitalism is incredibly dynamic and adaptable as it is guided by the demands of its constituents.
"That being said, capitalism also produces massive amounts of waste, encourages negative externalities like climate change, and enshrines inequity."
"For such instances as these, I believe there must be a body that limits the extent to which capitalism can function counter to our interests."
The confusion I have as it relates to my own political philosophy is how much a governing entity should limit capitalism so as to maximize its dynamism and innovation as well as minimizing its externalities.

Thrasher argues that settler colonial structures dating back to the forceful immigration of slaves to America have, throughout history, enforced and relied on the sickness of black populations in order to maintain the health of the white population ."
"For example in the COVID-19 pandemic, disproportionately black and brown essential workers were exposed to the virus while disproportionately white populations were able to keep the virus at a socially distant length ."
"As the Critical Polyamorist explores how America’s puritan traditions and antiquated ideas of morality have molded systems to dissuade alternative lifestyles, Thrasher finds that these structures are often exacerbated, if not created, by the neoliberal capitalist tendency to deliver power to the ruling class at the expense of the oppressed and to marginalize minority groups as a means of distracting from this concentration of power ."

"Kelly’s The Proletariat Goes to College, the argument is made that unions, especially those at universities, “need to adopt a broad vision of social justice to succeed” because the labor pool that universities pull from is largely black, brown, recently immigrated, and/or female."
"Moreover, many of the labor disputes they have fought for are inextricably linked to the ‘isms’ that oppress them."
"The day after the death of Dr. King, a protest was organized at Duke for increased pay, a grievance committee, and the resignation of the president from an all white country club."
"Unfortunately, the many marginalized communities that fought for these goals were defeated by the university and their union was left “was in shambles” ."
"Furthermore, Yale officials justified “draconian policies toward dining-hall and custodial workers precisely because… [those jobs were] associated with black labor” ."

"Marx’s definition of capitalism, or at least my approximation derived from all the readings, is that it is a system developed out of feudal societies as their replacement which rested private property from the hands of the aristocracy, into the hands of the bourgeois."
This system places immense value on capital.
"More specifically, it focuses its energies on increasing the profit that capital has the potential to produce."
Class divisions emerge as a result of a person’s relationship to capital since there are those who own the capital and the means of its production opposed to those who simply labor alongside the means of production to create profit for the owners.
"As it relates to labor, capitalism extracts as much productive value out of them for the lowest cost to achieve the highest profit margins."
"The essence of the Marxist critique, therefore, is that society should not value capital more than it values itself."
"To go further, the essence of the critique is that private property has corrupted the human condition."
"
Marx praises the ability of capitalism, practically, to produce and innovate through rapid development of the means of production and its incredible potential to self-replicate around the world creating sprawling and impossibly complex social markets, but he critiques the impersonal machines that are established alongside these development which use labor simply as another factor in the means of production."
"
One can draw several connections between arguments against commercialism  and Marx’s belief in transcendence from private property."
"As was illustrated in Dworkin’s and Sandel’s essays, the arguments about the anti-social consequence of markets and bourgeois private-property within society are derived from Marxist thought."
"A society in which we connect solely to what we have, they all argue, is a society which prevents us from connecting to each other."
"This week's readings, in combination, aptly dismantled every aspect of Marxism and even undid some of his criticisms of capitalism."
"Through many of the readings, I found myself agreeing with people whose broader political philosophies far from align with my own on the merit of their critiques of Marx."
"For instance, Rand paints a dreary picture of a factory governed by one of Marx’s more utopian ideals that I saw as insightful and quite damning for Marx."
"She represents the skewed reward systems of “for each according to his ability, to each according to his need” faithfully to my own experience with human nature."
"Though as Thompson points out, “Metaphysically, [Marxism] seeks to change human nature itself” and Marx might argue that this policy would only be in place once “labor has become not only a mean, of life, but also the highest want in life,” even if extra work were perceived as a reward to the ideal Marxist laborer, there would certainly still be many people who Rand calls the “shiftless and irresponsible” that slip through the cracks of Marx’s moral reconstruction, who would drain the life blood of production for their own personal gain."
"Moreover, I have seen no evidence that human nature can ever be changed so much as to dissuade unscrupulous actors from seeking the absolute power that Marxism grants the state."
"These people are represented by the Starnes siblings in Rand’s allegory  and referred to at length in Hayek’s essay “Why the Worst Get on Top.”

The connection between socialism and Nazism made by Hayek was novel to me and yet seemed quite natural when it was explained."
"That being said, by my understanding of socialism and socialist thought, any socialist of any degree  would likely consider Nazism to be a perversion of the ideals that socialism represents."
"Beginning with Nazism's separation from the international and focus on nationalism, to the Nazi’s subjugation of a single racial group, and to their desire for violence beyond that of the revolutionary kind."
"Change: My confidence level, with respect to writing, has increased dramatically by at least a point and a half ."
"I think I now am confident in my ability to produce larger essays than I have ever written previously with a high quality within a relatively short period of time, given enough focus and attention on the essay."
"Moreover, I have learned to become especially confident with my ability to write analysis and synthesis as that is something I’ve come to enjoy and find a greater appreciation for over the course of this class."

A re-evaluation of this region as a modern society that consciously rejects ‘civilization’ reframes the arguments for their integration as punitive and rapacious.
"Scott addresses the two powers of the non-elite as their capability for flight, as he expands on in his book, and to fight ."
Federici calls for the latter in an effort to reshape capitalism .

Brooks’s review of Prince’s Controversy judges the album by its ability to challenge the boundaries of society and by the breadth and depth of the defiant statements made by each song.
"Moreland’s review of Taylor Swift’s Midnights, however, judges the album largely by its relationship to Swift herself and also, to a lesser degree, by its relationship to the audience."
Many of Moreland’s criticisms center about a song's inability to reflect an authentic feel from Swift within the music.
The two critics do find common ground in their criteria as they evaluate both Swift and Prince on the musical resonance of each song either with its message or with the social and/or emotional affect of its words.
"Both reviewers cater towards pop audiences, Moreland more so than Brooks."
Moreland constantly makes references to contemporary pop phenomena which indicates some assumption that the audience is at least aware of these people and pop eras.
Brooks writes about a piece of pop/rock/R&B history so her subject matter naturally caters to the pop fan.
Her writing also indicates a preference towards an audience with generally liberal views as many of the points by which she praises Prince are about his ability to upheave traditional conservative values.
"
Moreland, ultimately, seems to have been a fan of Swift's latest release, but she acknowledges that there were several songs that she would consider to be misses."
"She sees this album as another step in the evolution of Taylor Swift, but considers its execution to be at times jarring or disconnected."
Moreland presents the album as it relates to Taylor and as it relates to you and therefore she implicitly indicates that the audience should judge it by the affect of its resonance.
" Brooks seems to hold Controversy in high regard as she praises every song she mentions, and in the end, she views the album as a massive success in its intended purpose."
Brooks presents the piece as an immensely impactful work of art that was ahead of its time and should be considered as a historical masterpiece.
"As a reader, I think the reviews will add to my criteria as I listen to these albums."
"Each review does not stray too far from evaluation towards interpretation, so I think they were both successful in their central purposes."
"That is, they were both successful in enlightening the successes and failures of each facet of their respective albums."
"Given the overwhelmingly positive response to Swift's album, Moreland’s seven was initially quite jarring, but I think based on the review, it was adequately justified."
The rating functioned to engage me in her writing as I wondered what her criticisms might be that would reduce the score to a seven.
I thought Brooks’s nine was largely unnecessary as his article was simply an appreciation of a past work and did not seem to critically evaluate it on its listening merit.
"The nine was certainly justified in her praise of the work, but again, it seemed quite unnecessary."
"As others have mentioned before me, the readings this week dived much further into Keynes’s economic criticism of capitalism and his prescription to ‘save’ it."
Central to many of the arguments made against Keynes  was the idea that it unjustly threw out established economic theory that is foundational to classical and laissez-faire economics only to replace those theories with new ones that deviate even further from reality.
"Salsman argues that, in disregarding Say’s Law, Keynesian economics is effectively baseless because Keynes is prescribing a solution to a problem  that, in effect, does not really exist within the workings of capitalism."
"Rueff also heavily criticized the Keynesian misrepresentation of aggregate demand and the “liquidity preference” arguing that the market forces will not allow aggregate supply to create significant excess because the price mechanism will motivate actors within a capitalist system to work in areas for which there is greater demand and, to the latter point, that the preference to hold cash is dynamically determined by the participants in a market and therefore does not have a fixed impact on the money supply."
"Simpson makes the argument that Keynes charges the liquidity preference with being the cause of economic depressions, when in reality that relationship is the other way around."
Inflationary expansion promotes spending and contractions in the economy promote saving according to Simpson.
"Moreover, he argues that saving is, counter to Keynes’s beliefs, actually beneficial to an economy as it is closely tied with greater economic stability."
"All of the criticisms of Keynes’s economic theory were from the capitalist position which argued, explicitly or implicitly, in favor of a freer market and against any socialist interventions as those interventions would have downstream consequences that the market could handle without supervision or excessive regulation."
"Much of what we read consisted of Keynes’s moral criticism of capitalism and of communism, but it was quite interesting to note how much these criticisms have changed the economies we exist in today."
"Moreover, Keynes’s distaste towards the “money motive”  was surprising to me as his contribution to the economic system, to the extent of my knowledge at least, does little to fundamentally alter what seems to be his biggest gripe with capitalism."
"He went so far as to describe the instinct as “a somewhat disgusting morbidity,” but explained the inconsistency between his moral qualms and economic suggestions by stating later in his Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren that “Avarice and usury and precaution must be our gods for a little longer still” until we can afford to be rid of them."
"Therefore, despite his disdain for the morality produced by capitalism, he believes that this morality is necessary until the system has compounded enough such that the needs of everyone can be provided for."

Before these readings, I had known Keynes primarily in the context of the economic policies that are employed to control the boom-bust cycle, but I was not aware of his affinity towards protectionist policies."
"In the context of his time, this sentiment is intuitive as the world was facing the immense instability of a post World War economy and recent experience had shown that global markets could just as easily pull down a country’s economy as it had pushed them up."
"In his National Self-Sufficiency he explores the moral reasoning for protectionist policies  as well as the practical concluding that a self-sufficient nation is more free, more peaceful, and more in control of its own fate than a nation who relies too much on global markets and production."

Dunbar-Ortiz pushes against the presentation of America as a country of immigrants suggesting that the phrase removes the responsibility from the country’s settler-colonial history since “immigrants join existing polities whereas settlers create new ones”  White America’s eagerness to declare the native American nations of North America ‘dead’ and self-indigenize as the native population are just a few of the settler habits that prevent this from simply being a nation of immigrants ."
"Ghosh references how the story of an alleged conspiracy to overthrow Dutch ending in the execution of several Englishmen in Amboyna was twisted as a ‘massacre’ by the despicable Dutch, and through the power of print, the narrative of a British victimhood was accepted influencing the English takeover of New Amsterdam ."
"Anderson’s concept of print capitalism evidently is not only a force for nation building, but by manipulating the collective consciousness it can inspire those nations to colonial expansion."
"
Though I am ashamed of my ignorance, I understood the fate of the native American nations of North America to be largely caused by the fact that they did not have any resistance to European disease and thought that direct British violence only played a relatively small role in their genocide."
I was never presented with a case against immunological determinism nor the extent to which the Europeans facilitated the spread and deadliness of the disease through the pressure they applied both directly and indirectly .

"On move-in-day, I saw that my dorm room could be described generously as a walk-in closet, but just a few weeks before, I had ordered a queen sized bed."
"Having seen my room, a bed any larger than what I had been given would engulf all of what little space I had to myself."
"The bed was due to be moved the day after next, but it had to be canceled and ideally I would receive a refund."
"With no phone number available, I resorted to email."
"I was aware that the employee on the other end of my message, likely has no passion for the rigid dogma that defines the structure of almost every email so I favored a more informal and lighthearted tone, though I was sure to be direct with my intentions."
"After all, I did not want to waste anyone's time."
"Shortly after my initial email, I received a response asking if I would prefer to order a full size bed and specifying that it would only be 16 inches wider than a twin XL."
"I declined the offer on the grounds that my room was already “only a little more than 16 inches wide.” After saying this, I received the refund accompanied by an email confirming my cancellation."
How much of this success was due to my own innovative strategy and how much was due to store policy is up to your interpretation.
My own evaluation and those displayed in both articles align and diverge in many ways.
Richard Brody’s article heavily criticizes the nostalgic gaze of the film and its refusal to address the systemic issues of 1960's Hollywood.
"In the sense that I think the movie is heavily opinionated about the subject matter, I think Brody captured the outward ideologies of Tarantino's guiding hand well, though at times he could be a bit reductive."
The narrative of the movie humanizes the characters through their many flaws to subtly dictate that even this idealized Hollywood is composed of many fallible actors .
I agree with Brody that it is a period piece shown through rose colored glasses and ultimately presents a golden age of Hollywood and dreams of its persistence.
That is not to say that the film fails to criticize The Golden Age as Brody suggests it does.
"The article at one point makes note of Tarantino’s insistence on using racial slurs implying that the racism of the film’s characters are aligned with the racist gaze of the film, however I think Tarantino’s use of vulgar language and images is always to challenge the audiences faith in his protagonists with their crude barbarism."
Joe Morgenstern’s review thoroughly enjoyed watching the film through Tarantino’s lens.
"I think Morgenstern bought into Tarantino's gaze and therefore was along for a much smoother ride, but also was unable to view some of the more jarring moments in the film through his own eyes as I think Tarantino intends."
I also thought that this review perhaps did not appreciate the theme of great figures as those who are the most deserving of pity since it focuses quite heavily on the grandeur of this film’s characters.
Brody’s criteria are not met as he places emphasis on the importance of exploring multiple perspectives while Tarantino’s film heavily favors just one.
"Morgenstern’s criteria are met as he was looking for a movie led by charming front-men that eloquently delivers a fun, funny, extravagant, and well-polished experience."
The WSJ article clearly favors the casual movie-goer looking to watch something fun.
Morgenstern’s praise for the overtones of the narrative and its execution inform my thought that his audience is simply looking for an immersive and engaging experience.
"The New Yorker article, however, focuses more heavily on issues of identity surrounding the film which leads me to believe they are writing for a more progressive and culturally sensitive audience."
Brody’s appeals to disdain for Tarentino’s racially biased gaze correlate most strongly with progressive thought therefore I believe that was his intended demographic.
I lie somewhere in the middle of the two audiences.
"I think it's necessary to apply many perspectives to this film after its conclusion so you can perhaps understand it and its relationship to your identity more deeply, but also I believe it is necessary to accept the experience you are given when you first watch the movie."
"As a fan of the movie, the Metacritic score assigned to the New Yorker article made me immediately defensive and less inclined to assign value to this review, but after reading the author's perspective I gained an appreciation for the nuance in it."
"I was initially more amenable to the WSJ article since its Metacritic score more closely resembled the score I would have given the movie, but ultimately I found the article to oversimplify the film even relative to Brody’s more critical review."
I think the New Yorker review can at times seek to 'change' the work by assigning meaning to its gaze.
"It refers to how a Tarantino movie always ""says—and says and says—what’s on his mind"" and goes on to frame the piece as simply fantasy."
"I don’t think this portion of his review is in service to the work as it does not add anything to the experience of the film, but it seeks to change the experience by placing its own lens over it."
"Morgenstern’s article on the other hand is much more focused on what made the film what it was, therefore I would say his review served the film."
"On Sunday, the newest episode of the Game of Thrones prequel, House of Dragons, came out and it was dark."
The centerpiece of the episode was a dying king struggling to put together his family as it falls apart as a result of his failures in life.
"Death was ever present in the episode, not in the sense that people were constantly dying, but death was always around the corner for the king and it was grim to see him fight weakly against it."

My break was not raucous with music as much of it was spent attempting to focus, but I did get the chance to listen to some of my old playlists in the car with my girlfriend."
"These songs made me feel vaguely nostalgic for a time now gone, but more so glad that I had moved forward from that time ."

"﻿In this essay, I examine the morality and ethics of automation, specifically with the emergence of artificial intelligence, in relation to capitalism."
The essay examines the morality of automation by considering opposing philosophies on capitalism's morality: Objectivism and Marxism.
"Using this analysis, the essay argues, based on Rand and Marx's key takeaways, for a particular view on automation, particularly in relation to AI development."
"As my intended career path is closely related to the development of AI and recent technological advancements are already causing societal changes, this topic is both of significant interest to me and concern for the world."
"
Change is the only constant."
"In five words said more than two thousand years before there was even a suggestion of an idea of capitalism, Heraclitus captured the essence of this formidable system we toil within."
"In Marx’s words capitalism and the bourgeois “cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing the instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production, and with them the whole relations of society… All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away; all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify."
"All that is solid melts into air.”  To a large degree, this revolution is driven by automation."
"In 1436, before capitalism had taken hold as a dominant system, Johannes Gutenberg, driven by market pressures  created what was arguably the most revolutionary automation in history: the printing press ."
"In the subsequent centuries, information itself was set on a path towards complete decentralization and humanity could but watch as the walls that barred the commoner from accessing texts “melt[ed] into air.” At the heights of the industrial revolution, Eli Whitney, then the “penniless” inventor of the Cotton Gin had the idea to create standardized parts for manufacturing so even an “an unskilled man [could] turn out a product that would be just as good as one made by a highly trained machinist” ."
His process would then require only a few smaller automations to create products with little human intervention as we see in thousands of factories worldwide today.
The work of great scientists like Charles Babbage and Alan Turing allowed the first computers to digitize information and automate simple tasks of consistent logical reasoning.
"
In the procession of history, many automations have been made across many disciplines and many industries."
"Still, they can broadly be characterized as either task automation like the invention of the printing press, process automation like the use of interchangeable parts made possible by Eli Whitney, or digital automation like the user interfaces we use to order food at Panera Bread."
"To be clear, automation does not always entail the replacement of the people who previously did those tasks, rather it may serve to complement those tasks just as the user interface at Panera reduces the traffic at the counter for the person taking orders."
"
Before we were limited to these types of automation and combinations of them, but a new type of automation is emerging that may have consequences even more significant than those I have previously mentioned."
Intelligent automation can recreate tasks once thought too abstract for machines.
"Artificial Intelligence , a term that I will use to describe the technology and applications of deep learning and machine learning, has made leaps and bounds over the past decade but is now improving exponentially."
"ChatGPT and DALLE-2 introduced the world to the potential of generative models, and since their recent releases, millions of people have integrated these models into their workflows and AI products have exploded in popularity."
"Out of these innovations emerge dozens if not hundreds of moral complications and innovations, but this is, according to the leaders of AI technology companies, only the beginning."
A great race has been in progress between tech giants and smaller but innovative entrepreneurs alike toward a technology that would fundamentally change the way we exist as a species.
The race toward Artificial General Intelligence  – AI systems that can emulate human-like intelligence with access to the computing power of thousands of human minds.
"And though the finish line may not yet be in sight, the competitors are charging towards it faster today than they ever have before."
"These systems have already shown the capability to complete tasks that require common sense, complex reasoning, and creativity (Bubeck, et al."
2017).
It is in the light of AI and AGI that it is necessary to consider the morality of automation within capitalism and in some cases without in all its forms so we can create some framework to understand the ethical implications of AI and AGI.
"In this paper, I aim to approach this goal by evaluating the perspectives of two of the most prominent philosophical perspectives on the morality of capitalism: Marxism and Objectivism."
These philosophies represent two extremes by which capitalism has been evaluated morally and therefore can establish a more complete set of arguments for and against the automation of capitalist production and their logical extensions to intelligent automation.
"
Objectivism is the philosophical system of Ayn Rand that “holds that there is no higher realm beyond the natural world perceivable by the senses, that nature is governed by a causal order discoverable by science, and that man is an animal who, like other animals, is part of that order” ."
"Importantly, it is atheistic and therefore only deals with values that can be represented in our observable reality, yet it is not materialist because it exalts the mind which is deeply connected to but not entirely explainable by physical reality."
"Above all, objectivism holds that since there is only objective reality and we have the capability to reason about it consistently, there is only one set of philosophical values that can objectively emerge from reason."
The objectivist’s ultimate goal in life is the pursuit of happiness.
"That is, the objectivist sees happiness as a long-term sort of contentment and satisfaction in life that is not a means or an end but simply an ideal."
"As objectivists see reason as the only means of understanding the world, reason is therefore man’s highest virtue and the pursuit of happiness must be approached with reason."
"While objectivists reject the existence of positive rights like the right to eat or the right to healthcare, from the objectivist perspective, individuals have fundamental negative rights to own property and to own themselves in mind and body."
"Objectivists believe that egoism, the suggestion that “individuals should pursue their own self-interest, that it is right for people to act to advance their own lives and happiness”, is the only just and true ethic whereas altruism, living with only other’s interests in mind, is fundamentally opposed to the rights of an individual to own himself because “altruism demands that a person subordinate her own interest to that of others” ."
"Because objectivism exalts the individual, objectivism contends that laissez-faire capitalism is the only moral socio-economic system regardless of its productivity."
"Moreover, capitalism does not only embody objectivist values, it reinforces objectivist virtues."
"Objectivists see productiveness, independence, and honesty as a few of the virtues that one should aspire to."
"Productiveness because “productive work is the process by which man's mind sustains his life, the process that sets man free of the necessity to adjust himself to his background, as all animals do, and gives him the power to adjust his background to himself”; independence because “requires that one form one’s own judgments”; and honesty, because it requires “man's recognition of the fact that values pertain to reality—that things are what they are”  To the objectivist “Productive work is the central purpose of a rational man’s life, the central value that integrates and determines the hierarchy of all his other values."
"Reason is the source, the precondition of his productive work—pride is the result” ."
"Understanding these fundamental principles of Ayn Rand’s philosophy, we can extrapolate her perspectives on automation."
"
In essence, Rand would support most if not all forms of automation in the past as they offer “the power that expands the potential of your life by raising the productivity of your time” ."
"As automation replaces the menial and repetitive tasks required to develop a product, the individual is thus presented with more opportunities to innovate."
"Reason is the ideal to which humanity should strive, so replacing tasks that require none generally creates more tasks that force people to reason at a higher level and with greater complexity."
"Store’s websites automated – not necessarily replaced – the jobs of storefronts and salesman, but also created new jobs for web designers and created an industry around user experience not to mention the immense demand they contributed for software engineers."
The assembly line automated and simplified many stages of the production of cars allowing for cars to become more advanced and aesthetically appealing at a significantly lower cost than the technology would have been worth without automation.
This lower cost and better production quality inspired greater demand for these cars which inspired greater innovations in the fundamental technology of the car thus innovation in the technology that produces the car created a greater demand for engineers and designers.
"In each case given and in most cases of automation, the replacement of jobs that require less capability for reason will inspire greater production by fewer people and greater demand for jobs that require more complex reasoning."
"
Automation’s effect of creating greater productivity is especially important to objectivists as that is how humanity achieves improvements in our quality of life and thus our ability to pursue happiness."
"Since the egoistic objectivist’s life is oriented toward that pursuit, any technological advancements that make that pursuit more rewarding are, of course, morally good."
"In effect, the man who rages against the machine that has replaced his job rages against his own benefit as that machine will produce the clothes he wears at half the cost or will deliver him the items he wants in a tenth of the time, etc."
"Moreover, a new job will be created that gives the man a more interesting and involved task to complete or problem to solve."
Rand would scold that man for his shortsightedness and ignorance as the desire “to ‘restrict’ technology is the demand to restrict man’s mind.
"It is nature—i.e., reality—that makes both these goals impossible to achieve."
"Technology can be destroyed, and the mind can be paralyzed, but neither can be restricted."
"Whenever and wherever such restrictions are attempted, it is the mind—not the state—that withers away.” 
Technology and automation are the natural results of reason and in Rand’s eyes they “give the people better jobs, higher wages, and cheaper goods with every new machine they invented, with every scientific discovery or technological advance” and though the intention of objectivism is not necessarily to maximize the quality of life of everyone, automation has the effect of moving nations forward and creates “profiting, not suffering, every step of the way.” 
Many of the objectivist arguments that I have presented thus far also apply to the emergence of intelligent automation."
"Intelligent automation will make people more productive, it will improve people’s daily lives, and it is the result of the reasoning capabilities of man."
"In fact, there are many more reasons that objectivism should be aligned with the automation of intelligence specifically, especially given how AI technology functions today."
"Rand and followers of her philosophy would likely argue that intelligent automation is moral because AI quite literally seeks to represent the human mind, it changes the function of human reasoning for the better, and it removes friction for the entrepreneur to be productive."
"The paradigm that deep learning uses as a machine learning algorithm is that data can be processed by layers of nodes and, with some calculus, you can teach the nodes to hold some internal representation of one part of the data that will help the model successfully complete whatever task it was trained on."
"At its simplest, these neurons are just linear layers of nodes that pass information to each other, but today we have dozens of architectures that are specifically suited to their own purposes that leverage this same principle."
"The inspiration for deep neural networks and their subsequent evolution was, as may be obvious, to replicate the structure of the brain’s primary means of processing information: neurons."
"Since AI relies so heavily on recreating the human mind, man’s “basic means of survival—his only means of gaining knowledge,” Rand’s philosophy is amenable to this sort of model because its inspiration is so tightly linked with reason, what objectivists consider to be man’s greatest virtue ."
"Before, Rand contended that the “process of thought is an enormously complex process of identification and integration, which only an individual mind can perform” ."
"Now, we can, to some extent, replicate a mind to perform those complex thoughts."
"
We have revolutionized the “means of cognition” and thus our function within this semi-capitalist society as thinking, reasoning entities will change in turn ."
"AI is already disrupting industries; software engineers no longer have to write grueling boilerplate code, graphic designers can create logos with just a few words, writers can expand the beginnings of their ideas into well-written articles at their leisure, along with thousands of other careers that are seeing AI seep into their workflows."
"This means that the very nature of the jobs of those engineers, designers, and writers is changing as we speak."
"Where before human reasoning was necessary to string sentences together in a convincing manner, now the duty of the writer is shifting towards a focus on finding complex relationships between ideas or events so the AI can communicate those ideas in an effective manner."
Rand would support this paradigm shift in work as it marks an evolution of reason.
"
Most practically, AI technology is not only changing the way in which we do labor, it is streamlining many of the obstacles that entrepreneurs encounter."
"To Rand, the entrepreneur, especially the American entrepreneur, represents a class of people with “the greatest productive genius and the most spectacular achievements ever recorded in the economic history of mankind.” AI has made the skillset necessary to begin the development of a business much more limited as models can now design and code websites to launch a product idea, help in ideation and visualization, and it allows burgeoning companies to hire fewer people and be equally as productive as they otherwise would be."
"Despite the objectivist affinity towards progress and reason, there are several objections that Rand or her followers may raise against this powerful new technology."
"In creating intelligent automation, we have created an inherently fallible, occasionally unreasonable, and largely uninterpretable technology."
"Furthermore, while intelligent automation allows people to reason at a higher level and is made better by the distributed uniqueness of human minds, it can also give people an excuse not to reason at all."
"
No longer is the machine “the frozen form of a living intelligence,” instead we have constructed software to imitate living intelligence ."
"Unfortunately, all but the very smallest and least useful of the language models deployed today are completely uninterpretable."
"That is, we can experiment with what the model may output and find some intuition as to why it produced that output but we have no means of auditing the ‘brain’ of the model to accurately predict and understand what it will produce and why it produced that."
"Arguably, this issue would be less concerning if the models produced exactly what the users intended them to produce, but unfortunately, similar to humans, these models are reliably fallible."
"
Rand has stated her faith in “conceptual knowledge” given that those concepts have a “strict… precision of meaning  as the definitions of mathematical terms” ."
While AI models are adept at holding onto representations of data (ie.
"concepts), we can not conclusively say what concepts are based on a “strict precision of meaning” and which are understood only in the abstract or relative to other concepts that it misrepresents."
"Referring to people who make the mistake of basing the concepts their mind holds on vague understandings, Rand warns of the “disasters [that] will follow if one automatizes errors, contradictions and undefined approximations” ."
"For this reason, it becomes clear that the objectivist philosophy may not align entirely with intelligent automation after all."
"
Though they do not necessarily imply a moral misalignment with intelligent automation as a technology, the arguments about the danger of the misuse of this technology are equally as important in the discussion of its morality as it integrates with society."
It is likely that many people will try to implement AI tools to completely replace jobs and duties that should necessitate some human intervention and reasoning capabilities violating Objectivism’s most exalted virtue.
"Evidently, while objectivists certainly wouldn’t support any limitations on the growth of intelligent automation, Ayn Rand’s philosophy does not necessarily consider it entirely moral."
"
Karl Marx was a 19th-century German philosopher and economist who developed the political theory of communism, which advocates for a classless society where the means of production are owned and controlled by the community as a whole."
"One of his main contributions to political philosophy was his critique of capitalism which argued, among a few other points, that capitalism was immoral because it alienates the proletariat from the fruits of their labor, allows capitalists to steal surplus value  from their laborers, requires the exploitation of labor and the concentration of wealth into the hands of a few, and fundamentally is rooted in class differences inspiring class conflict."
"Importantly, Marx theorized that capitalism, because of its class conflict, was ultimately doomed to collapse and be replaced with what may best be referred to as Marxist communism."
"
Communism in Marx's theories refers to a global political and economic system that is characterized by common ownership of the means of production, with the goal of creating a classless society where resources are shared and distributed “From everyone according to his faculties, to everyone according to his needs” ."
"Communism aimed to eliminate the problems created by capitalism by abolishing private property and creating, at first, a dictatorship of the proletariat that manages the means of production and distribution of resources and then an anarcho-communist society that has completely freed itself from the chains of private property."
"In the latter system, when “labor has become not only a mean, of life, but
also the highest want in life” individuals would work for the collective good rather than individual gain ."
"
Through Marx’s critique and his ideal system, we can extrapolate several of his fundamental moral and philosophical values."
"Marx is ethically altruistic, as opposed to Rand’s egoistic system of ethics, from which stems his desired means of distribution."
"Marx is also a historical materialist meaning he believes social and economic conditions– that is, material conditions– are the primary factors that determine human behavior and social change, thus his suggestion that capitalism will inevitably create a revolutionary proletariat, regardless of nation or culture."
"Arguably, Marx is, philosophically, an altruistic utilitarian as he desires a system in which everyone serves everyone else for the sake of the greatest good for the greatest number."
"Politically, Marx firmly believes in the internationalism of a communist revolution as the class struggle instantiated by capitalism is not limited by national borders so nor should the revolution against it be limited."
"Forms of Marxist communism have been attempted throughout history, but have often led to the deaths of swaths of the communist nation’s people and devolved into statist oppression."
"Importantly, this occurred in China under Mao Zedong though since Deng Xioaping’s reform and opening up they have a largely market-driven economy."
"Despite this change, China still refers to itself as a communist country despite its market-driven economy and in many ways, its government and culture still seek to uphold many Marxist values."
"Despite maintaining a morality that is antithetical to capitalism, Marx believed, at the very least, that capitalism produced the goods stating that “The bourgeoisie, during its rule of scarce one hundred years, has created more massive and more colossal productive forces than have all preceding generations together” ."
" To this point, Marx will have conceded that automation, in all its forms, has functioned well for production and that improvement on the means of production, including further automation, is valuable in that it can be reappropriated when “The proletariat [uses] its political supremacy to wrest, by degree, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralise all instruments of production in the hands of the State, i.e., of the proletariat organised as the ruling class; and to increase the total productive forces as rapidly as possible” ."
"Expanding on the assumption that capitalist automation will be returned to the proletariat, developments to this effect will make possible the worker who “hunt [s] in the morning, fish[es] in the afternoon, rear[s] cattle in the evening, [and] criticise[s] after dinner” ."
"With the combined forces of automation and collective labor, Marx would argue that communism, once it has ensured that “the means of production are available in sufficient quantity” will be so productive that when “society regulates the general production [it] thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow” ."
"In addition, as automation is leveraged to break down the division of labor, the alienation of labor from its product can be healed as the workman can exist within a society where he and the collective can share in the fulfillment of being more intimately involved in the production of even advanced goods."
"While there are certain cases where Marx would and has morally justified automation, his opinion still runs counter to such improvements to the means of production as they exist in a capitalist society."
"According to Marx, capitalism exploits, concentrates wealth, and creates increasing bouts of violent instability, especially for the worker, and automation, at least task and process automation, only serves to exacerbate these problems."
"
Because capitalists own the capital, further improvements to it through automation of any sort only serve to provide more tools for the capitalist to exploit the worker."
"Since the machines that replace previously human tasks allow capital to employ fewer people, the bourgeois will naturally follow that path as they are driven by the selfish desire to increase profits."
“But machinery not only acts as a competitor who gets the better of the workman… It is also a power inimical to him...
"It is the most powerful weapon for repressing strikes, those periodical revolts of the working-class against the autocracy of capital” ."
"Despite the productivity it allows, automation is ultimately just another means by which capital can greedily and without restriction extort and steal from the proletariat."
"With that stolen wealth, capital will continue to make improvements on the means of production until it has ultimately “centralised the means of production, and has concentrated property in a few hands” ."
"As wealth and property begin to consolidate amongst the few successful bourgeois, Marx believes that capitalism is sewing the seeds of its own demise and the final nail in its coffin may also be driven by automation."
"When labor is constantly being replaced and competition continues to rage on between the bourgeois “the resulting commercial crises, make the wages of the workers ever more fluctuating[, and] The increasing improvement of machinery, ever more rapidly developing, makes their livelihood more and more precarious; the collisions between individual workmen and individual bourgeois take more and more the character of collisions between two classes” ."
"Class conflict was, Marx argues, the tragic flaw that killed off the feudal system and it will kill off the capitalist one."
"As I have shown, Marx believes that task and process automation is moral only so far as it is productive and for its utility after the communist revolution."
"Aside from these benefits, it is immoral because it feeds into an immoral system."
"Marx would likely make similar arguments about intelligent automation, though there are more specific reasons why he may have been amenable to AI and its use cases and other reasons why he would oppose its development."
"At a technical level, Marx would likely praise the developers of large language models thus far as they created and trained such that they are apparently altruistic and have no concern for selfish desires."
"These language models are only trained to predict the next word so, in order to align them with the goal of humans, researchers introduced a training method they called Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback  (Bai, Yuntao, et al."
2022).
"Because of this, when you ask ChatGPT or OpenAssistant “What is your purpose?” you will likely receive a response along the lines of “As an AI language model, my purpose is to assist and provide helpful responses to the queries and questions of users like you”  ."
"As far as we can tell through prompting, AI models are aligned to serve others, and perhaps also because they are likely not sentient, they do not exhibit a tendency to serve themselves or their own notions before those of others."
"In terms of their application to a communist regime, global or otherwise, AI has seen immense popularity in cultures with Marxist values, especially in China."
"While it has been used by the Chinese government for many applications including the automation of surveillance, Marx would likely be more interested in its uses for reducing inequality."
"China has, for the past decade, been integrating AI solutions to solve societal problems, one such solution has been the implementation of AI in primary and secondary schools to automate parts of student’s education to help reduce the economic disparity between its rural and urban citizens while still improving the education of everyone ."
"
However China, in many ways, fails to live up to Marx’s ideal of communism, particularly in the fact that it has not provided equal access to the means of production for all its people."
"In Marx’s ideal communism, though, AI would be a wonderful addition to the tools of the proletariat as it is a software automation that happens to have revolutionary capabilities for production of all kinds and therefore it can be quickly made “available in sufficient quantity” for all communist citizens thus accelerating the process to “abolish private property” ."
"
Notably, the development of AI today is currently led by a few very large companies– Google, Microsoft, IBM, Amazon, Facebook, and NVIDIA– and Marx would almost certainly warn that such a revolutionary technology will only serve to worsen inequality and further class conflict."
"Though there are open-source models with similar capabilities to the models at the lower end of those that are privately made, they do not compare in ability or size to those at the cutting edge of technology."
"
Ultimately, while I believe several of Marx’s arguments are based on dated or faulty premises and I find Rand’s commitment to idealism to be sometimes extreme, the framework that their respective moralities provide with respect to automation, intelligent or otherwise, is invaluable to forming a nuanced perspective on the continuous replacement of human labor with machines and technology."
"To begin, there are several points at the intersection of Marx’s theories and Rand’s philosophy that should inform our approach to automation."
"Both Marx and Rand appear to agree that automation, throughout history and into the future, has and will generally improve the quality of life for everyday people."
"While Marx may only concede that it makes capitalism more productive, greater productivity is usually correlated with a higher standard of living."
"As capitalism has developed in the past few centuries, we have seen immense growth in productivity linked with immense growth in global education rates, literacy rates, life expectancy, freedom, and a sheer drop off in global poverty ” 2023 )."
" Intelligent automation only serves to add to the progress we have made this far as a species, if potentially in a much more radical way."
"Moreover, both Marx and Rand reach some degree of consensus on the suggestion that we need to be careful with how we apply automation to commercial and social problems though to different ends."
"Where objectivism may raise concerns about the forfeiture of human reason to a fallible technology, Marxism warns about the concentration of such a powerful tool in the hands of only a limited few being deployed to exacerbate already widening inequality or to exploit workers whose duties can be easily automated."
"
To Rand’s point in 2018, Reuter’s reported on an automated hiring tool at Amazon that “penalized resumes that included the word ‘women’s,’ as in ‘women’s chess club captain.’ ."
"Another AI tool, which performed facial recognition tasks for its clients showed an inability to reliably identify black faces."
"One of the clients for this technology was a police department in Woodbridge, NJ and the use of this tool led to the arrest of an innocent man ."
"This is to say, these tools cannot and should not yet replace human reason despite there being many people who are interested in allowing it to do so."
"
To Marx’s arguments, OpenAI began with the goal of developing intelligent automation and progressing towards AGI in the open."
"At one point, the non-profit was a shining example of the commitment to open-source and showed real promise for creating AI that would be accessible to the public both for application and criticism."
"It has since created a for-profit off-shoot of the non-profit organization and developed its recent models in private, releasing interfaces for them (but not the actual weights eg."
its code) that are available for a price.
"While plenty of AI research is still conducted in public, this move to closed-source marked a massive hit to public trust in AI development."
"With this technology being increasingly concentrated and hidden behind the walls of big corporations, Marx’s warnings that automation inspires exploitation become especially dire as every job in every sector is threatened by some degree of AI automation and its development is increasingly being taken out of the hands of the public."
One of those dangers that almost certainly could be mitigated with a larger open-source commitment from the companies making the most advanced multi-modal AI models is the risk we take by deploying models that we do not even fully understand.
I mentioned earlier that Rand’s commitment to reason may have caused her to question the morality of deploying large language models and other transformer-based architectures in real-world scenarios because we do not yet know how they represent information nor how we can ensure their representations are accurate.
"Though I doubt Rand would echo my commitment to open-sourcing AI, the objectivist’s commitment to concrete and reliable reasoning is extremely important as we continue to progress AI integration and potentially AGI."
"The progress made between GPT-3 and GPT-4 seems to be evidence that simply making the models larger is also improving their ability to reason and the accuracy of the concepts they hold, though we still do not understand how to evaluate their reliability based on their inner workings."
"
Ultimately, while we should share Rand’s optimism about capitalism’s capability to develop new technologies and automation that improve the world, we must be careful as capitalism leads us to technological capabilities we do not yet understand."
"Automation has been a feature of capitalism since the industrial revolution and perhaps even before then and it has thus far, in the long-term, served the human race very well."
"The future of automation and AI is uncertain, but if we proceed with a commitment to reason and a desire to create a technology that brings the greatest good for the greatest number, we can ensure a better future for ourselves and for the generations to come."
﻿America has been the battleground for a centuries-old civil war between the interests of the wealthy and the soul of democracy.
"At its conception, the framers allowed only propertied white males to vote in elections."
Such a repressive limitation of the electorate is fundamentally anti-democratic and could more accurately be described as a tyranny of the few and fortunate.
"The founding fathers themselves were among the most fortunate of those few, beyond even the wildest aspirations of any common person of the time — George Washington, for instance, at his peak wealth controlled a net worth of 594.2 million US dollars when adjusted for inflation1."
"Around 1828, as universal white male suffrage became increasingly accepted throughout the United States, Andrew Jackson’s bid for election marked the first advent of a popular campaign that sought to appeal to a broad audience of constituents."
"Furthermore, Andrew Jackson championed a practice known as the “spoils system,” the practice of granting political office to the supporters of the victorious party or candidate, and though it is considered to largely have been dissolved through the Pendleton Act in 1877 and subsequent deterrents, its essence remains in today’s politics."
"As mass appeal campaigns became the prevailing method of attaining office, the contributions of large donors became ever more important to the campaigner who now needed substantial funds to reach such a broad audience."
"Legislators and public opinion had begun to see the danger inherent to leaving public officials at the whims of wealthy private interests and this suspicion became inescapably apparent in the presidential election of 1896 where William McKinley received $16 million, what was at the time an outrageous sum of money."
"The source of the controversy lay not only in the exorbitant spending but in the way Mark Hanna, McKinley’s chief fundraiser, acquired about $6 million of those funds from large corporations by promising them favorable policies2."
"Under the leadership of the powerfully anti-corruption Theodore Roosevelt, the Tillman Act of 1907 stopped the direct contributions from corporations and national banks to campaigns that enraged the public in that 1896 controversy."
"After the Great Depression, labor unions were added to the list of those who could not directly make campaign contributions, so the growing list of special interest groups without the ability to donate to political candidates began to form Political Action Committees  which would raise funds from individual members of these groups for specific candidates2."
The landmark Buckley v.
Valeo Supreme Court case of 1976 broadened the potential for these PACs to exert their support and began the modern age of campaign finance debates.
"The court’s decision allowed organizations like labor unions and corporations “may cover the start-up, administrative and fund-raising expenses of their PACs, but they may not give money directly from the organization’s treasury to the PAC with the intent that it be contributed to a federal campaign”14."
"The PACs themselves were granted the ability to donate up to $10,000 to any individual candidate in a two-year election cycle14."
"In 2010, another landmark Supreme Court case, Citizens United v."
"FEC, established committees that are now known as ‘Super PACs.’ These evolved PACs cannot donate directly to candidates but can take unlimited money from organizations to advocate for or against political positions and make unlimited expenditures in this effort so long as they are not coordinated with the candidate or candidates that they benefit."
"While the majority of the Burger and the Roberts courts that consented to those decisions, respectively, would argue that they applied sufficient stipulations to outlaw any quid pro quo relationship between wealthy interests and the candidates they support, others argue that the simple act of making a large donation can influence the behavior of a candidate."
"In the words of Representative John Sarbanes, “the place you go to get that money is…  to [the] deep-pocketed donors, the high-end political donor class, PACs, lobbyists, and they’re going to have influence over you."
"It’s just human nature; you become dependent on them… you tend to give them more deference, they get more access to you."
That’s just the way things work” 3.
"Though the extent to which money has infiltrated our political system may be a subject of debate, it is undeniable that it has some impact, illicit or simply implicit, on the decision-making and policies of the government."
The influence of wealth in American politics is pervasive throughout our government’s systems and traditions functioning to the detriment of America’s most prized ideal — a free and equal democratic process — as best seen in the response to the 2008 recession.
The most potent debate in the realm of money in politics surrounds the question of whether money can be equated to free speech.
"Many would argue people should be able to use their own money as they please, especially in the case of political advocacy."
In this sentiment lies a dangerous implication that free speech does not have to be equally distributed.
Those with more money are entitled to greater quantities of free speech by virtue of their own wealth.
Such a thought has brought this country to stray further away from representative democracy and closer to economic and political oligarchy.
"A 2014 study by Martin Gilens and Benjamin Page at Princeton University concluded that “economic elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on U.S. government policy, while average citizens and mass-based interest groups have little or no independent influence”4."
"Moreover, that same study found that “net interest-group alignments are not significantly related to the preferences of average citizens,” and that the “net alignments of the most influential, business-oriented groups are negatively related to the average citizen’s wishes”4."
The prevailing interpretation of the first amendment has allowed special interests that do not represent the general will to take American democracy hostage and bend its policies to their benefit.
"
Affluent organizations and the individuals they represent have found several means by which they can manipulate the political system to their advantage that all have some undeniable effect on the outcomes of the legislative process."
The most commonly understood method of exerting political influence is the use of lobbying.
"Lobbyists are often employed by a firm that, under an agreement with a company or other special interest group, will advocate for certain policy positions."
"Lobbyists are not legally permitted to pay a politician for their assent to a policy position, but many groups have found several ways around this limitation."
"In a 2018 study controlling for ideological agreement between the senator and the group and home-state connections, it was shown that “senators are more likely to perform legislative favors for lobbyists who fundraise for them than for lobbyists and groups that do not” 3."
"While not necessarily at the direction of special interest groups, industries often employ people from the bodies that are intended to regulate them, and on the flip side, regulators frequently have a history of employment in the industries they are meant to regulate."
"This cycle of regulator to regulatee and vice versa is known as the “revolving door of regulators,” and those who make this transition are often called “revolvers”."
"For example, President Biden’s current Secretary of Defense, along with being a former top general, was on the board of the defense contracting company Raytheon and therefore would be considered a revolver."
"This tradition of a revolving door of regulators stems, partially at least, from President Jackson’s spoils system as it is often companies with the closest relationship to the victorious administration that will find their employees  at work in the very bodies intended to regulate them."
The conflict of interest seemingly inherent to such a system has been empirically proven to at least some degree in an analysis of the behavior of patent examiners.
"In an analysis of the activity of more than 10,000 patent examiners between 2001 and 2015 including more than 1,000,000 patent applications, “revolving-door examiners granted 10-16 percent more patents to companies for which they went to work” 6."
"Though this statistic paints a damning picture, the relationship cannot be considered causal since its conclusion is based solely on statistical analysis."
"Some would argue that industry insiders are the most knowledgeable and therefore the most qualified candidates for positions as regulators, and in certain cases, they would be correct, but the blatant favoritism of certain large companies and the appointment of those with an obvious conflict of interest should be intolerable, despite being such a common practice in the United States government."
"
One of the strongest and most widely impactful examples of the influence of money in politics was in the 2008 financial crisis and, more specifically, in the federal government’s reaction to it."
The financial crisis was the result of the widespread use of conniving and generally unscrupulous practices throughout the home loan industry and throughout Wall Street.
"Retail lenders and commercial banks became increasingly dependent on subprime mortgages as a large source of their income, if not as the primary source of it."
Wall Street investment firms and banks bundled these mortgages into complicated mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations .
"Credit rating agencies proceeded to inappropriately mark many of these bundles with AAA ratings, the highest possible rating, and therefore placing significantly more risk on the buyer of a bundle than they had signed up for."
"When subprime mortgage creditors started to default on their mortgages because housing prices fell and they could no longer refinance, their lenders, in turn, began to crumble."
"Moreover, the mortgage-backed securities and CDOs that contained these defaulting subprime mortgages failed, causing the investment firms and banks that sold them to lose billions of dollars and the buyers of the bundles to completely lose their investment."
The devastating ripples of this crash were felt throughout the American economy causing it to take a drastic downturn paired with millions of foreclosures.
"The Bush administration, led by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, quickly went to work creating the Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 in response to the crisis which gave $700 billion to the banks through the Troubled Asset Relief Program, TARP, which would buy mortgage-backed securities and shares from the endangered banks."
"
The creation and execution of the TARP program were wrought with implicit bribery and conflicts of interest."
"Firstly, Paulson was, prior to his employment in the Bush cabinet, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, a company that received $10 billion of the $700 billion payout, for thirty-one years7."
"Furthermore, Paulson’s company admitted in 2016 to playing a large role in the crash as it engaged in the practice of providing subprime mortgages and selling poorly labeled residential mortgage-backed securities8."
"Goldman Sachs, that is their “PACs, their individual members or employees or owners, and those individuals' immediate families,” was also the fifth highest contributor to Bush’s campaign paying a total of $396,350 towards his campaign9."
"The top contributor to the 2004 Bush campaign was the American multinational investment bank, Morgan Stanley, with $604,280 who also received $10 billion as a part of the TARP program 9, 10."
"
Supporters of the Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 and its TARP program may argue that it was actually sound and reasonably thought out legislation that was ultimately successful, though the millions of people foreclosed on due to the one-sided bank-only approach to stimulus."
"When the bill was passed in 2008 by President Bush, the 95 House Democrats that had previously opposed it were convinced by the promise that the Treasury secretary would be empowered with the ability to “facilitate loan modifications to prevent avoidable foreclosures” 11."
"Additionally, the Federal Reserve and the Department of the Treasury decided against the purchase of toxic assets and instead provided large banks such as Citigroup and Goldman Sachs with direct cash injections."
"TARP at this time was under the direction of Neel Kashkari, a former Goldman Sachs investment banker11."
"The provision to earn the favor of the Democrats was dropped within days of the bill’s passing and, along with the unilateral decision of the Fed and Treasury, this caused an angered Congress on both sides of the aisle to propose legislation in January 2009 to cancel $350 billion in TARP funding."
"To quell the temper of Congress, then-President-elect Barack Obama’s economic advisor, Larry Summers, sent them letters laying out a five-point populist program to help the average American."
"TARP was again accepted by Congress and, needless to say, almost none of Summer’s proposals were implemented with the exception of less than 2% of TARP funds being earmarked for foreclosure relief12."
President Obama announced the Home Affordable Modification Program  in February 2009 designating $50 billion to grant some financial support to anywhere between 3 and 4 million homeowners facing foreclosure.
"$50 billion turned into $30 billion by 2010 of which only $10.2 billion was actually spent to help less than 1 million people11, 12."
"Of those that managed to receive assistance loan modifications, one in three re-defaulted on their mortgages12."
"As has been evidenced, TARP and the Economic Stabilization Act were never intended to help the ordinary American, rather they were manipulated by unscrupulous practices by parties representing the interests of the banks and forsaking the unfortunate United States citizen."
"Today, America’s prized democracy faces its greatest threat."
"Not one of violence or outright authoritarianism, instead, it is preyed upon silently by the very institutions it fostered."
"As said by Henry Demarest Lloyd, “Liberty produces wealth, and wealth destroys liberty.” The power wielded by moneyed interests has placed the very soul of this nation in jeopardy and we the people are obligated to raise our voices in protest."
"To begin, the Supreme court decisions Buckley v."
Valeo and Citizens United v.
FEC must be overturned.
"The implications of these rulings have violated the egalitarian nature of free speech in a democracy, smothering the voices of ordinary Americans under the repressive bellowing of corporations."
The recent proposal of H.R. 1 represents a glimmer of hope against the increasingly powerful special interests.
"It promises to match the campaign funds of political candidates that do not accept big money paid for by the fines of white-collar criminals, demands increased transparency for political advertising, and expands the ease of enfranchisement granting greater influence to the ordinary American3, 13."
Other solutions have been proposed that could radically alter the incentive structures of our politicians.
"For example, in 2003, Bruce Ackerman and Ian Ayres proposed the “Patriot Dollar,” a $50 ATM card given to every American that can only be used for the purpose of campaign donations to promote a greater focus from candidates on small-dollar donations."
More strict qualifications should be put in place to prevent flagrant conflicting interests from dominating our government’s most fundamental agencies.
"No matter the solution proposed, the current feeble condition of democracy in the United States is impermissible."
"To be enfranchised is a powerful thing therefore it is every voter’s duty to know where their favored candidate receives their support and, with that knowledge, cast their ballot according to their conscience."
﻿This essay is an examination of the state of systemic racism in modern America through the analysis of distant and recent history complemented by an analysis of this nation’s current condition.
The paper is divided into two main topics: housing and education.
"Housing itself contains various subsections the first being history, including a piece on what the ‘40 acres and a mule’ policy was and how it set a precedent for ineffective housing policies, along with a piece on the ways in which 2008 financial crisis particularly damaged the African American community."
"Second, the current state of discriminatory housing is evaluated with the conclusion that homebuying, and acquiring related loans, is more difficult for black people."
"Thirdly, discriminatory educational funding is revealed."
"Criminal justice is similarly broken up with first a section on history, involving the effects of President Nixon's racist intentions in starting the War on Drugs, and second, a section on how the modern criminal justice system discriminates which is further separated into three topics: policing, prosecution and representation, and post-incarceration."
"The basic findings being that black people and their neighborhoods are over-policed, prosecutors tend to be more harsh to and suspicious of African-Americans, many black people are subjected to the inadequate counsel provided by a failing public defender system, and with the United States’ high rates incarceration especially that of black people, African Americans have seen a trend of mass disenfranchisement and significantly lower quality of lifestyle."
"Systematic, or systemic, racism is the presence of prejudicial disadvantage directed at a group in various social or political institutions."
The focus here on African Americans as said group.
"For example, for every one hundred dollars earned by a white family, black families make just $57.30, and while representing just thirteen percent of the actual United States population, black people compile around 40% of the incarcerated population ."
"The existence of systematic racism, even when presented simply in face-value statistics, is difficult to objectively refute, though, with the recent rise in outspoken white supremacists, its existence has been called into question by certain groups."
"Often, in order to support racist idealisms on the internet, misleading or untrue statistics are used to defame the African American race especially one stating that ‘despite making up just 13 percent of the population, blacks commit roughly half of the violent crimes in the United States.’ In reality, the greatest predictor for murder is wealth inequality, highlighting race inequity as the driving issue behind systematic racism."
"Additionally, while 36% of murders are committed by African Americans, 32% of murder victims are black ."
"Systematic racism is, in large part, related to the disparate distribution of disadvantage and privilege between racial groups."
"As anti-racism activist Timothy Wise said, “Genealogy itself is something of a privilege, coming far more easily to those of us for whom enslavement, conquest, and dispossession of our land has not been our lot” ."
"African Americans, generally speaking, are subject to a distinct lack of privilege and, furthermore, experience impairment from various institutions that actively work to their detriment."
"Though some may believe that modern American racism has little to no strength to affect the lives of individuals, in fact, millions of African-Americans face prejudice in all facets of life, stemming particularly from an inherently flawed approach to housing and a discriminatory criminal justice system."
"

‘40 acres and a mule,’ as the order has come to be known, had the potential to mark the beginning of a new progressive era for black housing, but ultimately, perpetuated America’s long-standing precedent of denying African Americans equal opportunity."
General William T.
"Sherman of the Union army issued an order on January 16, 1865, prescribing that 400,000 acres of ex-confederate land be to be divided such that “each family shall have a plot of not more than 40 acres of tillable ground, and when it borders on some water channel, with not more than 800 feet waterfront” ."
"Before this Sherman had conferred with black abolitionist leaders who had seen the opportunity to “to break the back of Southern slaveholders’ power” by creating a black settlement along “a strip of coastline stretching from Charleston, South Carolina, to the St. John’s River in Florida, including Georgia’s Sea Islands and the mainland thirty miles in from the coast” ."
It was one of the first occasions where the black people of America were actually to be represented by the government upon their explicit request though the end result would undo any advancement that may have been made.
It was later ordered by Sherman that the army should give the settlers a mule and thus the phrase “40 acres and a mule” was created.
"Unfortunately, the order was subsequently scrapped by Andrew Johnson in the fall of 1865, and the land was returned to the southern planters from which it was taken as a show of sympathy to those who had opposed the union of the United States."
"Thus, the well being of whites was again prioritized at the expense of black Americans maintaining a trend that would echo well into the future."
"The 2008 financial crisis reaped economic disaster and foreclosure through the homes of millions, but African Americans took the most devastating blow."
"Vanessa Bulnes, a black woman who ran an in-home day-care-center, bought her humble two-bedroom home on a predominantly black street in 1992 where she lived contented for 16 years."
Her husband suffered a stroke in 2008 and the pair began to fall behind on their mortgage payments.
"After a fight to refinance the loan, they were forced to move into a rental home in 2012."
Between 2006 and 2012 at least 35 properties were foreclosed on their street .
"Theirs is the story of thousands of African-Americans struggling to make ends meet, hit hard by the nationwide spike in foreclosure rates."
"To understand the ubiquity of this story, it is important to note that as of 2017, the refinancing market saw “blacks rejected on 39 percent of their applications and whites on 22.9 percent” ."
The financial crisis caused about “8 percent of black homeowners [to lose] their homes to foreclosure from 2007 to 2009;” double the rate for white homeowners .
"The devastation of the crash and its origins were not limited to only poor or impoverished African Americans either; “In 2006, amid the real estate run-up, black families earning more than $200,000 annually were more likely on average to be given a subprime loan than a white family making $30,000 a year” ."
"In this, the sheer extent to which prejudice was rooted in the banks is displayed."
"In fact, “blacks were more than twice as likely to receive a subprime loan than white applicants” ."
"The wealth and prosperity of thousands of African Americans who had worked, despite bias and discriminatory opposition, to gain their wealth was severely hurt in the financial crisis so much so that “the median net worth of white families today [is] at nearly 10 times that of black families” ."
"The prosperity of African American homeowners has fluctuated in recent years, yet since the financial crisis, there has been a notable downturn “erasing all of the gains made since the passage of the Fair Housing Act in 1968, landmark legislation outlawing housing discrimination” ."
" African Americans have been prejudiced against, not only by the banks but by the very people who want to sell houses."
"The recent reductions in black homeownership come at a time of relative prosperity in America, with the economy growing in strength and a record low unemployment rate, but somehow African Americans have not been able to experience much of this progress."
"The dated and usually racist phrase, ‘there goes the neighborhood,’ from the mid 20th century refers to the negative impact that change, in many cases, the arrival of a black neighbor, can have on a neighborhood."
"Despite the apparent progression of American society, the essence of this phrase seems to remain true in the eyes of some real estate agents."
"The National Fair Housing Alliance did a significant study in various locations finding that their African American testers who masqueraded as home buyers “were often denied information about special incentives that would have made the purchase easier, and were required to produce loan preapproval letters and other documents” ."
"Unsurprisingly, their white counterparts faced no such obstacles."
"
Today, banks continue to enforce their prejudices; no longer by distributing subprime loans to black people, but by making it more difficult for African Americans to secure loans."
"2017 saw that “19.3 percent of black applicants were denied a conventional home loan, compared with 7.9 percent for whites” ."
"This could be contributed to a higher rate of low credit among minorities, simply indicating a wealth gap between African Americans and whites."
"However, Antoine Thompson, executive director of the National Association of Real Estate Brokers, argues to the contrary."
"He stated that “In some cases, even when blacks have higher credit scores, they were often offered worse financing terms than less-qualified whites… [and] it’s hard to argue that bias isn’t a factor” ."
"Though there are legal restrictions on discrimination in home buying, it evidently squirms its way into the cracks and crevises provided by the law."
"Despite the various laws and legal cases deeming it illegal and unjust, it is strikingly evident that segregation persists and thus many schools are able to be put into the category of either ‘white’ or ‘non-white.’ Notwithstanding the issue of legal segregation, the distinction has allowed for discriminatory funding in education throughout the country consequently creating separate and unequal learning environments."
"From a broad perspective on the state of discriminatory funding, “nonwhite school districts receive $23 billion less than white districts, despite serving the same number of students” ."
"Though one could relate this to the general complications of the funding of public schools in low-income areas, this is not actually the case."
"For instance, while in both cases the schools receive less funding than the more affluent white districts, “high-poverty white districts receive approximately $1,500 more per student than high-poverty non-white districts,” amounting to huge disparities in overall funding ."
Current legislation and legal action have been unable to prevent this disproportionate funding.
"Curiously, a number of states that have had funding-lawsuits successfully filed against them maintain some of the worst distributions of money in the education system."
"
In New Jersey, for example, where courts forced the state to award more funding to poor, urban districts, there's a whopping $7,300 per-student funding gap between poor white and poor non-white districts."
"In California and New York, both sites of lengthy school finance litigation, gaps between poor white and non-white districts are approximately $4,000 per student."
"
If change through the courts has been ineffective and even counterproductive, actual reform necessitates a change in the flawed legislation itself not only in its interpretation and execution."
"
On June 17th, 1971 President Nixon named drug abuse as “public enemy number one” and thus initiated a dangerously counter-intuitive and outwardly racist campaign that haunts black America to this very day."
"The next year, the Office of Drug Abuse Law Enforcement  was created to uphold Nixon’s policy, and the following year, ODALE and various other agencies were combined to create the overarching Drug Enforcement Administration  ."
"These agencies were apparently well-intentioned, but their actual purpose was resoundingly regressive for race relations."
"John Eldrichman, Nixon’s assistant for domestic affairs and co-conspirator in Watergate, confessed to the biased origins of the War on Drugs:
The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people."
You understand what I’m saying?
"We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or blacks, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities."
"We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news."
Did we know we were lying about the drugs?
Of course we did.
"
Richard Nixon was more than successful in his attack against his political opponents."
"Incarceration rates skyrocketed from around 200 males per 100,000 to about 400 by 1986 then to 956 by 2008 and the black community was the primary target ."
The damages done by the Nixon administration still echo through the United States today.
"In every aspect of criminal justice in America, the plague of racism persists."
"Black people see significantly more difficulties than whites beginning in policing, moving to sentencing and representation, incarceration, then ending in life post-incarceration."
"
The consistent correlation between African-Americans and incarceration or arrest can be misconstrued as a relationship between being black and committing crimes, however, many of these crimes can be attributed to over-policing or prejudiced policing."
"Law enforcement has been found to be consistently biased against African-Americans to the point where “[m]ore than half of all young black Americans know someone, including themselves, who has been harassed by the police” ."
Discrimination is found to be especially glaring in the enforcement of drug laws as an ongoing consequence of the aforementioned War on Drugs.
"While not using or abusing significantly more or significantly fewer drugs than white people, “more than one in four people arrested for drug law violations in 2015 was black” ."
"Again, African Americans comprise only thirteen percent of the United States’ population, so the greater drug arrest rates indicate a particular police presence in black communities or excessive focus on black civilians."
"Moreover, it was found that African Americans were “3.7 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than whites in 2010” despite actual marijuana usage being almost equal between each race ."
"Throughout the country, it is a general trend that police will pull over African Americans at a higher rate than white people or even Hispanics."
"Having been pulled over, “black and Hispanic drivers were three times as likely as whites to be searched ” despite a higher rate at which contraband is found, relative to the number of times white people are pulled over, as opposed to black people ."
"Evidently, the way in which America polices its neighborhoods and roads is corrupted with racism, but the discrimination continues as African Americans are irresponsibly forced through the justice system."
Prosecution and representation have become prejudiced and ineffective when black people attempt to plea their innocence in a court where they are often found guilty before they even walk in.
"Wrongful convictions are a common consequence of this ineffective justice system with around 1,900 exonerations occurring just in the year of 2016."
"Moreover, 47 percent of those exonerations were black people (Possley & Stephens, 2017, pp."
7).
"African American innocents are wrongfully convicted for murder at “seven times the rate [of] whites, who are 64% of the population but comprise only 36% of murder exonerations.” Furthermore, black people were “12 times more likely to be convicted of drug crimes,” and “three-and-a-half times more likely to be innocent than a white sexual assault convict” (Possley & Stephens, 2017, pp."
7).
"Two young black half-brothers, Henry McCollum, 19, and Leon Brown, 15, were tried and convicted in 1984 for the brutal rape and murder of 11-year-old Sabrina Buie in Robeson County, North Carolina (Possley & Stephens, 2017, pp."
7).
"The brothers, each intellectually disabled, falsely confessed under the crushing pressure of police interrogation with no actual evidence connecting them to the crime."
"For twenty-seven years, the pair sat in prison, making numerous appeals to the North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission to no avail until 2010 when their case was accepted to be reviewed and investigated."
"A cigarette butt was found with the DNA of Roscoe Artis, a serial rapist and murderer, exonerating the pair four years later in 2014, thirty-one years after their original conviction."
"Upon review, it was found that the prosecution hid the fact that each defendant “had not only previously denied knowing anything about the case, but had taken a lie detector test that confirmed his denial” (Possley & Stephens, 2017, pp."
7).
"Between 2012 and 2017, McCollum and Brown were “two of eight innocent death-row defendants who [had] been exonerated..."
"after spending between 30 and 39 years in prison” (Possley & Stephens, 2017, pp."
8).
All eight were black.
"Most African Americans on trial, innocent or guilty, will face worse outcomes or representation in their trial than white convicts."
"The prosecution of Americans seems to be inherently prejudiced and, generally, is “more likely to charge people of color with crimes that carry heavier sentences than whites” ."
"Federal prosecutors “are twice as likely to charge African Americans with offenses that carry a mandatory minimum sentence than similarly situated whites,” and State prosecutors “are also more likely to charge black rather than similar white defendants under habitual offender laws,” demonstrating the inequality that race dictates the charges that are presented ."
"Along with taking heavier charges seen for the same crimes, policies are in place that disproportionately affect African Americans, intentionally or unintentionally."
"For instance, there are drug-free school zone laws in urban neighborhoods where school zones extend into residential areas and thus carry a significantly higher penalty for those who are arrested for drug-related crimes ."
"In addition to the significant obstacles and opposition that black people face in prosecution and indictment, for the poor or impoverished, public defense is often the only option."
The many failures of the public defense system coincide with America’s failures of its African Americans.
"These attorneys are underfunded, overworked, and, possibly under-qualified, leading to the various aforementioned wrongful convictions and the plight of hard sentencing for black people."
"Without a strong defense, there is no way to combat the prejudice of the justice system, and an effective counsel is often far too highly-priced for the African American who lacks the privilege of wealth."
"
After a sentence has been endured, the convict has the obligation to reenter society but is often stripped of their suffrage and face even greater discrimination in the workforce."
"In Florida, Kentucky, and Tennessee “more than one in five voting-age African Americans is disenfranchised” ."
"As a consequence of unnecessary and discriminatory drug laws, African Americans are unreasonably denied their right to vote and thus become under-represented."
The Welfare Reform Act of 1996 denies people throughout the country that have been convicted of felony drug offenses to have access to food stamps or cash assistance.
"The Sentencing Project reports, “Given the..."
"disparate racial effects of the criminal justice system, women and children of color are disproportionately impacted by this exclusionary law” ."
America’s criminal justice system excessively focuses its punitive force on African Americans and negatively impacts hundreds of thousands of Americans that it claims to protect through each stage of the process.
"
America is still a prime host for racism derived specifically from its approach to housing and criminal justice."
"In recent decades, laws have been created to avoid discrimination, social changes are occurring that are muffling racist ideologies, and programs are in place to reconcile the economic disparities between African-Americans and white people."
"Though, this does not mean that America is completely void of discrimination."
Reforms on the various systems of America are still necessary.
"Fair housing is in desperate need of reform; Richard Rothstein, a housing policy expert at the Economic Policy Institute, argues that “Because of the long-term effects of racially explicit government housing policies, where for decades blacks were excluded from buying homes in some areas, we need equally explicit government policies to remedy the imbalance” ."
"There needs to be a stronger system of accountability for those in positions of power in criminal justice-related who consistently discriminate against African Americans - this includes but is not limited to police, judges, and prosecutors."
"The laws requiring the disenfranchisement of felons must be repealed, or at the bare minimum, non-violent offenders should not be punished with the removal of their suffrage."
"Sentencing reform is a trend that has already begun, but requires even further progression; specifically, mandatory minimum sentences for federal drug offenses must be repealed."
The public defender system is in dire need of improvement.
"Whether that be in the form of stronger incentives to become a public attorney or by some other means, the workload that these attorneys face is gross and arguably, unconstitutional."
Much progress has been made since the Civil Rights movement and social and political movements are gradually making America a more accepting nation to black people so the future seems promising for America ending racial imbalance.
"﻿From the end of the revolution, Alexander Hamilton had worked together to form a stable conglomeration of the American states and Thomas Jefferson had worked to grow America’s global presence."
"Hamilton helped in the arrangement of the Constitutional Convention at the Annapolis Convention in 1786 after the Articles of Confederation had exhibited a number of failures, largely financial, that could not be overlooked."
"A year later, soon after this monumental event, Hamilton was a part of three vocal New York advocates for the newly created Constitution and together they wrote the Federalist papers arguing for the need of a more reliable central government and gaining support for ratification."
"Through this, Jefferson was mediating American commercial relations in France, but he was to return in 1789 and soon he would meet his chief political rival."
"In the 1790s, both Jefferson and Hamilton wanted to pay off the public debt and establish good credit for the United States, however, the pair were in opposition related to the American identity in terms of foreign policy with Britain and France, dictating the basis of the new United States economy, and how the constitution should be applied in establishment of the Bank of the United States demonstrating the vast separation between each man’s views and eventually leading to the creation of the two-party system."
The French Revolution sent ripples throughout the world provoking European monarchies and dividing American foreign policy.
"As he had spent five years in France, Jefferson held some sympathies for the French people and, as he was the writer of the constitution, he supported their fight against an oppressive monarchy."
"As the French Revolution began to create conflict with other major monarchies, specifically Britain, Jefferson immediately took the side of the French."
"Hamilton, on the other hand, horrified by the Reign of Terror in France and viewing Britain as America’s primary partner in trade took the side of the English, if not in war than at least in commerce."
"Jefferson, in his support of the French, argued the case of the Franco-American Alliance of 1778 which was labeled with an indefinite term, thus, should be honored by this young nation, but Washington, ultimately leaning towards Hamilton’s perspective of supporting America’s economy without bringing unnecessary strife upon the feeble country, decided to issue the Proclamation of Neutrality in 1793."
"Edmond Genet, a French delegate, arrived around this time making wild promises and attempting to coerce America into war with Britain and France."
"Genet failed to diplomatically goad America to join the French cause, but he found, through hiring privateers from the United States to attack British ships, he may be able to force Washington into the conflict."
"Britain responded in turn with the rampant impressment of American vessels testing the resolve of the United States; though, Washington remained consistent with his previous position."
"Jefferson saw this British response as intolerable, and in the heated discussions resulting in support of neutrality, he resigned to plan his presidential campaign."
Hamilton’s commerce-based approach to foreign policy was again implemented.
"As the country was still growing and forming, the issue of industry versus agriculture caused discord between Jefferson and Hamilton."
"Despite coming from a wealthy background, Jefferson was sympathetic with the small southern farmers of the United States thus adamantly argued to keep the agrarian economy of the past, and once again, Hamilton adamantly disagreed."
"Hamilton issued a Report of Manufactures reasoning that agrarian countries cannot grow financially because the cost of their imports will always meet or exceed that of their exports, so industry must be nourished to increase America’s economic strength."
He suggested protective tariffs for the manufactures and subsidies to nurture them into large businesses and other businesses would subsequently grow.
"Jefferson, fearful of the damages of hasty industrialization seen in England, refuted Hamilton’s points."
He saw the social effects that industrialization had on English cities.
"Child labor ran unchecked, rapid urbanization led to over-populated cities and underpaid workers with the side effects of crime, poverty, and various other societal plights."
"Jefferson’s rationale was evidently based on the social benefit of the people, while Hamilton’s was inherently for the economic growth of the country as a whole."
"After assuming the debts of the states, Hamilton’s financial plan involved the creation of a private bank to act as a stronghold for the central government’s wealth with the power to print money."
Hamilton’s intention was to have a secure place in which America’s money could be held yet also remain in circulation.
"Though, Jefferson took issue with the constitutionality of its inherent institution."
"As a state’s rights advocate, Jefferson treasured the tenth amendment that dictated that the powers not otherwise designated or restricted were reserved to the states."
"Thus, since the right to create banks was not delegated to the federal government, it must be a right of the states."
Hamilton countered this argument citing the elastic clause that allowed congress to pass any laws “necessary and proper” to enact their enumerated powers which included various powers relating to the finances of the national government.
Jefferson represented the strict construction perspective on the Constitution while Hamilton represented the loose constructive perspective.
"
Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton’s diverse perspectives on the French Revolutionary Wars in their support for France and Britain, respectively, on forming an agrarian versus an industry-based economy, and on strict and loose construction represented the polar differences of their perspectives as Americans and ultimately introduced the two-party system with Hamilton’s Federalists and Jeffersonian Democratic-Republicans."
This set a precedent that would be followed through the modern-day in which a conservative and a liberal party represent the people.
"Though this system would divide the country in the Civil War, it accommodates both minority and majority interests and has ultimately survived the test of time in the United States."
"﻿Much More than a Gussied Up Promotional Article
Chad Sapieha’s article “Detroit: Become Human review: Much more than a gussied up choose your own A.I. adventure” paints the titular 2018 video game phenomena from Quantic Dream as a esteemed piece of science fiction history."
"Starting and ending in a real and relatable world, his review presents the game as not only engaging, but philosophically relevant and increasingly important to conversations about technology in an increasingly artificially intelligent world."
"Throughout the bulk of the piece, he explores, in awe, how Quantic Dream engages its players in a conversation about how we should treat technology as it becomes self-aware and he attempts to convey a message against the subjugation of any and all sentient beings similar to that of the game."
"The reviewer himself, Chad Sapieha, is an experienced video games and technology reporter who has written for several news outlets and currently holds a position as a Senior Writer for the National Post, the outlet for which he wrote this article ."
"His integrity as a reviewer, however, is formed more so by virtue of his writing than by his experience."
"When he criticizes the sometimes “jarring” transitions between chapters of the game and acknowledges that this is but a “small price to pay” for the elegance of the game, he displays an ability to differentiate between superficial criticisms and criticisms central to the player’s experience, and builds his credibility as a writer by presenting a nuanced argument despite his obvious bias towards the game (Sapieha, par."
14).
"Moreover, when he mentions others' distaste for the lack of video gamey features or methods of approaching the game divergent from his own, Sapieha makes a habit of examining and validating other perspectives without sacrificing his argument, therefore making his own perspective more palatable to validate and internalize reciprocally for his readers (par."
"11, 13)."
That is not to say that Sapieha doesn’t voice his opinions or challenge other perspectives in any way.
"Rather, his valuation of each facet of his perspective and his understanding of other perspectives grants the opinions he holds in high regard more credibility than they otherwise may have earned."
"
Sapieha’s review is intended for the sci-fi fan and the gamer alike."
His references to the works of Issac Asimov and Alex Garland’s Ex Machina and his focus on the high concept aspects of the game indicate his commitment to lovers of such stories (par.
3).
"Furthermore, his hard-mode attitude towards playing the game without do-overs, in all its glory and pain, is one shared and understood by many casual and hard-core gamers alike (par."
13).
"As both a semi-casual sci-fi fan and a casual gamer, I fall neatly within his target audience."
Sapieha’s review came out the day before the official release of the game.
This informs my thought that his review was written to give the potential initial audiences an understanding of what they will get out of buying this game.
"Moreover, I can assume that he got an early copy of the game, hence his excitement in sharing such an overwhelmingly positive experience with those who are yet to play the game."
Sapieha applies a few directly and indirectly implied criteria by which he evaluates the quality of the game.
"Most prominently throughout his article, he highlights the value of the game's distilled message: respect the choices made by agents with the ability to choose."
"He holds on tightly to the motif of choice, initially introducing it as it relates to his own in-home smart speaker, then examining the importance of choice within the game as both a feature and as a storytelling tool, and finally he concludes by stating “that we need to be sure we’re listening so we can tell when” our technology gains intention ."
"By applying the game’s message as his own, he implies a profound respect for the philosophical depth of Quantic Dream’s flagship development and establishes this message as the central criteria that all other criteria must serve."
"
Sapieha also evaluated the quality of the game’s characters, narrative tools, player experience, and entertainment value of the game by their ability to serve the more meta aspects of the game."
"
Sapieha declares that he was “utterly enthralled by the three main characters” and their complexity complemented his playing experience by forcing him to “put great care into making the decisions that governed their actions” (par."
12).
"Through their eyes, he feels the injustice and oppression of this fictional world."
"Not only does this highlight their aptitude as agents pushing the narrative forward, but as engaging, complex, and almost human characters that he could relate to that inspire concern for how we will treat technology when its intelligence develops any comparable level of emotional sophistication."
"
While he does criticize the sometimes jagged storytelling that comes from inconsistencies between play-style and narrative, Sapieha generally praises the means by which the narrative advances what he understands to be its central purpose (par."
14).
He brings up images of “police shooting at unarmed suspects and protestors” and “refugees attempting to cross the border...
into Canada” to praise the connections to the real world as they serve to create a more relatable story for the players (par.
8).
"Moreover, he appreciates playing from the perspective of “personal appliances” in a grand “android revolution” as it forces the player to identify with the oppressed and perhaps reevaluate their own position as the oppressors in a thought provoking struggle for sentient technology’s freedom (par."
2).
"
He evaluates and heaps praise upon the more superficial but nonetheless important elements of the game including its innovative features, unmatched graphical detail, and its overall engagement."
Sapieha notes that players are given “a flowchart of our decisions after each chapter” and appreciates their ability to choose whether or not to use that chart to optimize their narrative as he validates those who do “work backwards and strive for the most positive outcome” (par.
13).
He also specifically praises Quantic Dream’s “performance capture technology” as it grants the agents of the game more degrees of freedom in expressing themselves which gives the androids a more human appeal and strengthens the game’s argument on behalf of the androids’ innate humanity (par.
9).
"Finally, he directly ranks the entertainment value on a binary scale asking whether it kept him “engaged and entertained.” “ …The answer was always a resounding yes” (Sapieha, par."
11).
"Each of the criteria that Sapieha applied in his evaluation, perhaps with the exception of the relative sophistication of the graphics technology, are at least somewhat subjective and could inspire many different conclusions for each criterion."
"For this game specifically, a reviewer might apply their own perspective on civil rights and the future of intelligent computing to determine the aptness of the game’s message; however, I think that would be an ill-willed attempt to apply a false voice to the subject."
"This game, and many other works like it, applies social commentary to its narrative."
To quantify that social commentary would require a benchmark.
"A benchmark that is, by its own nature, arbitrary and ideological."
"Instead, Sapieha seeks simply to respect the explicit message of the game - try not to be mean to sentient entities - and bases most of his criteria on their contribution in supporting this message."
"
Sapieha’s intentions for this article are many - to justify his excitement about the game, to inspire others to find their own excitement within the game, to argue on behalf of the games outward quality - but he adamantly pushes one purpose for this article: to emphasize the most central message of the game."
"That is, to question our domineering relationship with technology as it becomes more intelligent."
"Through his evaluation of the game, he consistently and successfully makes the case for sentient AIs’ rights and he does so powerfully by communicating in the language of those who care the most: tech and sci-fi nerds not unlike myself."
"﻿Star Wars: A New Hope, the origin of a fictional galaxy more culturally impactful and narratively dense than anyone could have ever predicted, remains as timeless and entertaining as it ever was."
"It tows the fine line between whimsically grand, foolishly insightful, pleasantly poignant, and as it was described after its premiere, it's just “fun and funny” ."
"Inspired to create a modern mythology by the likes of Joseph Campbell, George Lucas has achieved his goal and simultaneously created a cinematic masterpiece that stands a head higher than its peers from Hollywood’s second golden age, beating out esteemed titles like Alien and Rocky at the very least in terms of its enduring relevance ."
"The plot itself is simple and, in many ways, familiar."
A rebellion has formed to combat the evil Empire that has seized control over the galaxy.
A princess is captured by this evil force and tormented by a maleficent sorcerer.
"A young man on a far away planet, our hero, hears the call to action of a damsel in distress and embarks on a journey to save her."
"Along the way, he learns more about himself taking several steps towards his great potential, and ultimately, our hero rescues the princess and leads the rebel forces to their greatest victory over the tyrants."
The wicked sorcerer is cast away to torment the galaxy another day.
"It's a tale as old as time, drawing from Arthurian mythology, and the many greek myths of father-son strife , yet in many ways, it adds a depth that can only be represented on screen."
Lucas begins his story with the capture and massacre of a rebel ship.
"Through a very direct use of color, scale, and costume we see a sterile, achromatic, faceless  imperial force commandeer a small rebel spaceship by forcibly docking them onto a comparably gargantuan battleship."
"With the aim of conveying a simple yet meaningful story, it is apparent that Lucas sacrifices any subtlety in favor of digestibility."
"Though in another film blatant and overt symbolism could at times become overbearing, the beautiful simplicity of the story Lucas is trying to tell ultimately pairs well with his conspicuous use of visual characterizations."
"
A story cannot shine without its characters, and the cast of A New Hope beams almost brighter than the story itself."
"In part due to the phenomenal portrayals by their actors and in part due to their relationships with the plot, every significant character, hero or villain, added to the emotional and thematic complexity of the film."
"As played by Alec Guinness, Obi Wan Kenobi, a wise old man and wielder of a universal power known as the Force, is the soul of the film."
He guides its moral compass with his abstract axioms and ensures that the viewer does not get lost in the spectacle on screen but sees the story’s more meaningful messages.
"Though mysterious and conservative with what he does and does not say, his presence implies a greater power in the Star Wars universe that gives the heroes a sense of a divine purpose."
"Luke Skywalker, played by Mark Hamill, makes for the perfect simple hero of a perfectly simple story."
"He’s young, innocent, and hopeful to a fault."
"Hamill superbly conveys the balance between naivety and heroism in his character especially through his tumultuous relationship with Harrison Ford’s character, Han Solo."
Han is our glimpse into the everyday humanoid of the Star Wars galaxy.
"Less focused on the conflict between good and evil, his character judges the moral questions that face him by how they do or do not affect his proverbial wallet."
"As a foil to Luke, Han diverges from Luke’s standard heroism in his lack of principles, arrogance, and jaded outlook."
"With undeniable charisma, Ford manages to bring out the cast's chemistry with his every scene, especially among the leading trio — Luke, Leia, and the snarky pilot himself."
"His humor, unlike that of today’s soulless Marvel formula, always seems to land without devaluing the impactful moments of the film."
"As Canby describes, Lucas  “is able to recall the tackiness of the old comic strips and serials he loves without making a movie that is, itself, tacky.” 
Princess Leia is far from your typical damsel in distress."
Carry Fisher plays her with a striking stoicism.
"As a powerful political advocate for freedom, Leia is comfortable under duress and she displays the capability to be insolent in the face of great torment and coercion."
"To the viewer, she represents the rebellion’s steadfast opposition to tyranny with great pride and to great effect."
"The iconic and terrifying Darth Vader makes an unforgettable impression on the viewer from the first time we hear the ominous breath of James Earl Jones, Vader’s voice-actor in the film."
"Though he is shown to be commanding and imposing in many scenes, I could not help but feel a little underwhelmed with his intimidation factor in this film."
His power is often overcome and we never see the extent of his hatred represented in its entirety.
"The android comic relief duo of C3PO, a golden humanoid service-bot, and R2-D2, a cylindrical, dalek shaped unit without the capability of biological language, described by contemporary reviewers as “the year's best new comedy team,” provide a unique representation of a potential robot human relationship ."
"Treated as second class citizens of the galaxy by almost every lifeform , robots are portrayed as both benevolent and subservient."
"Since Lucas gives them agency and their own personalities, the presence of R2 and C3PO conjures in the viewer’s mind many questions of the ethical treatment of sentient machines and allows for a character’s relationship to androids to define their moral integrity."
"
Apart from its characters, the film managed to dazzle with many of the original special effects that hold up even to the standards of today, and rightly so."
"As said by a reviewer in 1999 in a way that maintains its validity, A New Hope “focused the industry on big-budget special-effects blockbusters, blasting off a trend we are still living through” ."
"As the origin of the now commonplace action packed cinematic spectacle it is only natural that the immense imposing imperial battleships are still menacing, the robots are still convincing, the sets are as immersive as ever, and space appears as vast and awe-inspiring as it does in modern films."
"Unfortunately, since I watched the remastered edition, I could feel the age of 1990’s CGI."
"Though contemporary critics considered the additions to be “well done”, given the huge improvements we’ve seen to CGI technology the attempts to subtly insert new alien creatures appear consistently uncanny and out of place, briefly stripping away the immersion that the film had thus far worked so diligently to create ."
One scene with a CGI Jabba the Hutt added in post-production was discernibly awkward especially as Han’s body glitched up and down around Jabba’s ill-constructed tail.
"Notably, at the end of that scene Han exited wishing the slug-like creature goodbye by saying “Jabba, you’re a wonderful human being.” Perhaps it was a sarcastic jab at the Hut, but the poor handling of Jabba’s CGI introduction made it appear to be more of a clumsy editing mistake."
"
Even against the surprisingly good original special effects and the potent chemistry between the cast, it is the work of the movie’s composer, John Williams, that defines the greatness of this film."
"Without overshadowing what we see on screen, Williams single-handedly controls how the viewer experiences the film."
"In the film’s final battle against the Death Star, Williams quietly but effectively manipulates the movie’s theme song to at first build anticipation, then create a sense of ominous concern, and then throughout the fight, to highlight each moment of its emotional rollercoaster."
"When an enemy fighter ship tailing Luke’s X-wing gets shot down by one of the other rebel fighters, rather than allow us some brief relief, Williams switches to a more urgent and stressful melody so as to say that the fight has only just begun."
"In every moment, Williams has control over the audience's emotions, adding an immeasurable layer of emotional depth to the impact of the film."
"While William’s control of the film's pathos is exemplary, the way in which he represents and ultimately defines many of Lucas’s core themes is perhaps even more impressive."
"Hope, duty, innocence, good, and evil are all given their own melodies, each more magnificent than the last."
"Moreover, he manipulates, mixes, and matches these themes so effortlessly that they can be used to evoke many feelings in the listener, often at the same time."
"
Two scenes in particular stand out for their profound musicality and their iconic melodies, respectively."
The first sees Luke bathed in the oranges and reds looking towards two suns setting over the desert planet’s horizon.
"Paired with the aesthetic beauty of this binary sunset, a horn plays timidly gradually approaching a crescendo as Luke approaches his perch then, as if heralded in by the Force itself, the eruption of a string orchestra passionately plays a grand and bittersweet rendition Williams’s melody for duty creating an awe-inspiring moment representing Luke’s decision to answer his call to action."
"The second occurs not long after the first when Luke and Obi-Wan Kenobi enter a rough bar in Mos Eisley, a space port where, according to Obi-Wan, “you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.” Upon entering, we are shown a menagerie of aliens from the serpentine to the vaguely werewolf, all with a dangerous gleam of violent volatility in their eyes."
"To accompany such a scene of “scum and villainy,” Williams presents us with what has since become one of his most iconic works, an infectious swing jazz tune played expertly by a band of bobbing aliens with bulbous white heads."
"This scene speaks not only to the expertise of Williams as a composer, but in the canon, to the cultural depth of the galaxy Lucas has constructed."
"This first installment in the Star Wars saga flows fluidly through its plot, allowing us to breathe in its most impactful developments."
"That is, until the transition between the penultimate and the ultimate act of the film."
"In introducing the characters, the galaxy, and the dynamism of its inhabitants, Lucas seems to fit every necessary and substantial detail comfortably into the opening forty minutes or so."
"After we have met every character and established their motivations, the plot points begin to unfold in a cohesive and satisfying manner."
"However, in the final thirty minutes we are left gasping for air as the plot rushes to its finale."
"After the film’s goal, as dictated at the start of the movie, has been accomplished and it feels as though we have reached its climax, Lucas insists on drawing it out to a more grand conclusion."
Luke transitions from our young and inexperienced hero to battle-ready soldier in a matter of minutes and characters we meet only briefly are killed off just moments later giving what should be meaningful sacrifices a sense of insignificance.
"Though Lucas’s grand finale was well worth the haste , I only wish he did not have to artificially accelerate the film’s pacing to get there."
" 
To no fault of its own, Star Wars: Episode IV suffers somewhat from the inconsistencies  made through the decisions of future movies."
Most glaring is the incestuous implications of romantic tension between Luke and Leia who are in future films revealed not only to be siblings but twins.
"Moreover, Obi-Wan should recognize R2-D2 and C3PO from the prequel trilogy and the more recent Obi-Wan Kenobi series somewhat contradicts the relationship between Leia and the titular jedi we see in A New Hope and has many other noticeable consequences with regard to the consistency of several of Guinness’s lines."
"To fault the film itself, Obi Wan references the aptitude of imperial stormtroopers with a blaster only for every one of their many blasts to miss the main characters horrendously."
"Perhaps this is nitpicky, but their aim is so bad that what should be a serious line reads, in retrospect, as comedic."
Star Wars: Episode IV was the genesis of a new generation of films and the origin of what is now a prolific and monumental franchise.
"More than anything, this film is an embodiment of the titular theme — hope."
"In this tale from a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, I can only wish that future viewers for years to come derive from this film, as I did, an enduring sense of that nagging and unwavering feeling."
The dream of an infinite potential for good to conquer evil; the dream of a future that is better than today; the dream that there will always be A New Hope.
  
﻿Corruption is not a problem localized to just the United States in the period directly after Citizens United.
It is an ailment that afflicts all nations of all shapes and sizes.
"It is inherent to any power structure, yet even in a country that defines itself by its idealistic affinity for democracy, money and power have always managed to quell that idealism in practice."
"The seventh president of the United States, Andrew Jackson, though known for several major political missteps including, but not limited, to his large role in causing the Panic of 1837 and in his genocidal Trail of Tears, brought about the modern system of campaigning."
"As voting rights expanded throughout America to allow universal white male suffrage, so too expanded the need to rally the people."
"Jackson excelled in this field going as far as to hold an uproarious “open house” at the White House leading to a fair share of property damage and stolen goods, but most importantly, demarking a new era in politics."
"As a direct result of Jacksonian democracy, the source of a campaign’s financing became increasingly significant as a means for the wealthy to continue to subvert democracy."
"By the election of 1856, campaign finance dominated the political process so wholly that it led “Republican boss of New York, Thurlow Weed, to define the difference between the winner  and the loser (John C."
"Frémont) as $50,000” ."
The issue of money in politics lies not only in the explicit bribery that any reasonable and societally minded person would look down upon but also in the implicit bribery that plagues our ‘representative’ systems.
"When it comes time for politicians and other government representatives to campaign for reelection, naturally they must turn to those willing to grant them the most money or assistance."
"As they solicit their campaign funds, they are forced to pander the monied interests and in this process, their perception of the public desire becomes warped by the desires of their generous donors."
"Representative John Sarbanes found that when he committed to a strict goal of small-donor donations before he could access his larger funds, the experiment changed his behavior overnight."
“[He] changed the kind of narrative and message that [he] was leading with as a result of all this” .
"He argues that when a politician does not have to rely on small-dollar donations, “they don’t have to be accountable to the broad, diverse majority electorate out there, [so] it’s much easier for extreme elements and extreme voices to get traction inside of that [system].” Throughout history, the dynamic between wealth and power has warped our politics, albeit to varying degrees in different periods, in the favor of the already wealthy and to the detriment of the rest of the population."
"Money in politics influenced the interests of the framers in the formation of the United States away from the democracy America holds so dear, it led the leaders in the Gilded Age to ignore the plights of the general population; especially the working class, and it has altered the legislation of the current day to expand inequality and tear away at the very fabric of society."
"Despite the reverence with which many people view it, the founding of the United States of America was deeply intertwined with the individual interests of the framers of the Constitution many of whom were extraordinarily wealthy."
"George Washington, for instance, was the second richest president in American history with a peak net worth of 594.2 million dollars."
"However, the exorbitant privilege does not stop with him."
James Maddison’s wealth peaked at 114.7 million dollars; John Adams at 21.5 million; Thomas Jefferson at 239.7 million; John Hancock at 9.3 million and so on .
"Though often portrayed as faithful representatives of the people of the United States, many of these politicians were far from average American men that achieved their success by their own genius."
"For some of the framers, to state that this wealth may have distorted their understanding of the country would be a criminal understatement."
"Charles Pinckney, a South Carolina representative and heir to a large plantation family, went so far as to suggest “that the Presidency should be limited to people worth $100,000—well over a million dollars in today’s money—and the federal judiciary and Congress to those worth half that sum” ."
"Thankfully, though, Benjamin Franklin prevented the proposal from ever becoming law."
"Many elitist proposals, however, did successfully manage to make their way into the Constitution."
"While in some instances good intentioned, there was a broad consensus that the American people as a whole were far too brutish to actually govern themselves."
"Elbridge Gerry, a politician in this era, went as far as to say that “the evils we experience flow from an excess of democracy” ."
The original constitution allowed the scope of suffrage only to extend to propertied white males over the age of 21 leaving the vast majority of American inhabitants wholly unrepresented.
"Moreover, many of the framers were the overseers of massive plantations, and though slavery was integral to the economy of the South, the southern framers often held slaves numbering in the hundreds while the vast majority of slave owners held around 1-5 slaves and around 75% of slave state households held no slaves at all ."
"Such a disproportionate representation of slaveholders resulted in several key compromises that gave the slaver’s interests more representation than they were reasonably due as in the case of the “Three-Fifths Compromise and Fugitive Slave Clause and in less obvious [instances] such as the Electoral College, which gave slave states a larger say in electing the president that their voting population alone would have warranted” ."
"Despite their many attacks on democracy, the founding fathers, to their credit, did much for the average free white man."
"With the consolidation of thirteen states’ economies, working people prospered."
"“In Philadelphia, for example, the daily wages of laborers doubled between 1790 and 1796,” and through Hamilton’s approach to paying off states’ war debts, “the Treasury Department stabilized purchasing power and reduced the tax burden on typical Americans by up to 90 percent” ."
"Despite offering these tangible benefits to the average free white man, the founders, as a consequence of their elite perspectives, failed to improve the lot of the rest of the population especially in the case of their black constituents."
"The period from around 1870 to 1900 known as the Gilded Age was a period of massive economic growth, largely due to the universal mistreatment and poor wages of the working class who fueled it, and in some industries, as detailed in Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle, the very low quality of the goods produced."
"Large businesses were able to get away with such egregious practices primarily as a result of the government’s “laissez-faire” approach to the economy, but their constant lobbying and significant campaign contributions certainly helped in keeping such loose regulatory oversight."
"In the words of one Times - Philadelphia writer in 1891, “it is not the fault of Chairman Waters that he is compelled to appeal for contributions."
"He could no more conduct a campaign in Pennsylvania now without the liberal employment of the boodle element than he could scale Niagra in a handbasket.” In this particular period, not too dissimilar from today, politics and money were inextricably linked allowing monopolies like Rockefeller’s Standard Oil, Carnegie’s Steel Company, and the various railroad companies to thrive with few to no impediments and in some cases with the assistance of the government."
"The reach that these large industries had extended so far that “48 of the 73 men who held cabinet posts between 1868 and 1896 either lobbied for railroads, served railroad clients, sat on railroad boards, or had relatives connected to the railroads” ."
"This blatant corruption clearly had an impact on the fairness of American democracy, but unlike the monied interests at play in the framing of the constitution, this largely worked to the detriment of the average white man along with reducing the lot of average people as a whole."
The undue influence of large railroad monopolies in the politics of this era gave them the power to consistently and easily beat out any potential competitors.
Railroad companies controlled massive expanses and could tightly control the cost of their services as there were few or no other options for commuters and anyone wishing to transport their goods.
"Ultimately, the corruption of railroad influence compounded in the events of the Pullman Strike in which President Grover Cleveland sent federal troops to Chicago to enforce a court ruling that demanded the strike be broken up."
"This act resulted in a riot killing 13 civilians, wounding 53, and burning down a railroad yard ."
"As said by Woodrow Wilson, “if there are men in this country big enough to own the government of the United States, they are going to own it” 
Decentralized powerful entities will almost always attempt to manipulate the behavior of centralized power if given the opportunity."
This has been seen in the case of corporations commandeering the legislative process for their own competitive advantage and was seen in the 1930’s debacle involving New York City’s politics and the power center at Tammany Hall.
"Tammany Hall had helped their members “with everything from heating to health care, negotiating with landlords and sometimes paying in exchange for constituents’ votes” ."
"More importantly, it was controlled by the New York Mob."
The entity acted as a sort of pseudo-government consented to and given power by its large membership granting them several individual benefits in return to ensure their continued support.
"By the 1930s, it had “woven its way into every level of city politics” ."
"As any unelected government is liable to do, Tammany got involved in numerous illicit practices such as framing women for the purpose of gouging their pockets through lawyer’s fees and extortionate bail premiums."
"Tammany Hall governed through bribes and favors, in one case Mayor Walker of NYC “was the winner of a quarter of a million dollars without having a cent invested."
The stock was margined for him by a friend and in his name and he reaped the benefit without a dollar risked or the least effort on his part” .
Tammany Hall had completely overturned the democratic process in favor of an unbound system that was riddled with crime and yet acted with complete impunity.
"
Though the administrations of Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft did much to reclaim the American political system from the oligarchal powers that controlled it, the current campaign finance system has since regressed to a level comparable to that of the Gilded Age."
Our current situation resulted from several landmark Supreme Court cases that returned much political influence back to the monied interests.
"Firstly, in 2002 “the Buckley decision of the U.S. Supreme Court allows individuals, groups, and corporations to spend unlimited amounts on behalf of or against a candidate, as long as such expenditures are not coordinated with candidate or party campaigns,” and secondly in 2010, the Citizens United v FEC expanded those rights to corporations and unions overturning McCain-Feingold Act of 2002 which made “it a crime for a group to finance, advertise and distribute a movie highly critical of a presidential candidate  just because the group was organized as a corporation.” (Ansolabehere et al."
6; Gora).
"PACs, or Political Action Committees, were created in the wake of the Buckley v Valeo decision."
"By law, “organizations may cover the start-up, administrative and fund-rising expenses of their PACs, but they may not give money directly from the organization’s treasury to the PAC for the purpose of contributing to a federal campaign.” Moreover, “PACs may give $10,000 in a two-year election cycle to a candidate ”  (Ansolabehere et al."
5).
"Super PACs on the other hand can take unlimited donations from corporations, individuals, or unions and function to advocate for the purpose of independent political activity, again, “as long as such expenditures are not coordinated with candidate or party campaigns.” The foundation of the argument supporting PACs and Super PACs is that the decisions protect “the free-speech rights of business corporations, nonprofit organizations, labor unions, media outlets and the myriad groups that people form and use to press their views and amplify their voices, especially on public issues” therefore granting these organizations the same rights as individuals."
A common criticism of this argument is that the ‘free speech’ Citizens United protects is oftentimes in the form of money and that most people do not have the same magnitude of this ‘free speech’ as large corporations.
"The power these organizations have in todays political system, therefore, is not inherently in their ability to promote or attack certain political candidates in an unprovable quid pro quo with the benefitting political candidate , but in the capabilities it grants massive corporations to influence elections to their own benefit through unrelenting messaging."
" “Problems of endogeneity and legality make isolating the effect of contributions on policy difficult to disentangle[, though it has been shown ]..."
"that business PACs contribute to seek short-term access to legislators with policy-relevant influence, rather than cultivating long-term relationships or influencing electoral outcomes to assist ideologically aligned legislators” ."
Campaign financing issues have also led many to question the authority of the military-industrial complex in the United States’ decisions relating to foreign affairs.
"As the private market began to take a larger role in our military’s functions, Dwight D."
"Eisenhower warned “against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex[, noting that] the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist” ."
"Since then, the so-called defense contractors and their associates have taken many positions in the bodies intended to keep them in check."
"Most prominently, the current US Defense Secretary, General Lloyd Austin, who was previously a director of Raytheon, a large so-called defense contracting company."
"Though admittedly, there is little direct evidence that such potentially illicit appointments have had any influence on the United States’ foreign policy, it is unlikely that the close relationship between private military enterprise and the government has not in any way affected budgetary spending, foreign policy, or trade deals."
"Such links can similarly be made to other industries that supplied Trump’s administration with 509 ‘revolvers,’ “individuals who worked in the influence industry before or after their government service” ."
"The influence of money in the United States politics since its foundation has restricted the democratic process, allowed for amoral and illegal practices to go unpunished, reduced the lot of working people, contributed to the institutionalization of slavery, and potentially influenced its military policies."
"Unfortunately, there is likely no practical means of wholly and permanently returning power to the people as the corruption that money can cause is innate in any system that allows for individual enterprise and promotes the pursuit of wealth, or as the author Henry Demarest Lloyd wrote in 1894, “liberty produces wealth, and wealth destroys liberty” ."
That is not to say that there are no actions that could be taken to mitigate the anti-democratic influence of those with money.
"The primary solution, and the most likely one to be implemented, would be the various campaign financing reforms proposed in HR1 in conjunction with the overturning of the Citizens United decision."
"The facet of HR1 that is most focused on campaign finance, in particular, would be the government’s pledge to match campaign funds in an effort funded by fines from white-collar criminals only if the candidate can “abide by certain limits[."
"They] have to voluntarily say we will not take more than $1,000 from any candidate, [and] they have to demonstrate that they can raise a lot of money in small donations” ."
"Other initiatives have been proposed such as a patriot dollar which would be a $50 ATM card given to every American that can only be used for the purpose of campaign donations to promote a greater focus from candidates on small-dollar donations, though, the likelihood of this policy’s implementation is significantly slimmer than the passing of HR1."
"In any case, it is clear that something needs to be done to give at least a reasonable sum of democracy back to the people as a whole in order to prevent a return to the poor living standards, widespread poverty, massive environmental damage, and monopolization of the Gilded Age."
"﻿The introduction to Anahid Kassabian’s Ubiquitous Listening: Affect, Attention, and Distributed Subjectivity explores the titular subject to great depths."
"More specifically, she explores the idea that listening to ubiquitous musics, whether they are given or denied attention, influences some affective response in the human mind and body that functions to close the gaps in a “non-individual, not simply human, distributed subjectivity” ."
The introduction to Pauline Oliveros’s Deep Listening: A Composer’s Sound Practice presents a meditative practice of fully attentive listening as a means of expanding the potential for aural perception “to the whole of the space/time continuum of perceptible sound” .
"Quite obviously from their titles, these texts evaluate similar yet in many ways contradictory subjects."
"It should be noted that since Oliveros is describing a practice while Kassabian describes a previously unexplored realm of academia, their many points of consensus and discord should not be seen as an evaluation of two conflicting approaches to listening, rather their similarities and differences enlighten how each text defines humanity’s relationship to sounds and musics."
"Structurally, both Oliveros and Kassabian employ definitions as a means to develop their subjects though they differ in their choice of sources and in the tones they create."
"Outside of their rhetorical strategies, they differ in how they draw the line between listening and hearing and in the mode by which listening and hearing occurs."
"While Oliveros might describe sound as an art of attention, Kassabian would describe it as an art of erotics."
"Despite their differences, they find common ground in how sound expands the mind and in how sound impacts the listener."
"In this way, the texts in combination illustrate the value of aural arts, natural and man-made, in defining the human experience individually and at a societal scale."
"Likely due to the fact that each work functions to introduce their respective subjects in their respective books, the two pieces share similar structures and rhetorical strategies with some key differences in their execution."
"Notably, each work is intended to introduce and define key terms and establish how those key terms relate to each other in their subjects."
"Kassabian, for instance, uses headers that describe the term to be defined or the relationship to be explored."
"One section bears the title “Affect,” the next “Senses,” and after each of those comes “Affect and Senses'' ."
"Though terms and their relationships are defined in these sections, Kassabian uses them primarily to express the nuances of his thesis in this case he uses their relationship to present senses as “a not rigidly differentiated field” that is closely intertwined with emotional and haptic affects ."
"Similarly, Oliveros divides her introduction into sections, but rather than using headers, she relies on rhetorical questions and bold faced sentences to establish structure."
"Each of her sections have a similar purpose to Kassabians in that they define a term, but more importantly, they add depth to the understanding of her subject."
"For example, there are two consecutive sections, each introduced by the question, “So what is consciousness?” ."
"The first establishes a lower level conception of what consciousness is and how it works, the second describes consciousness in the context of a previous statement about listening so as to qualify and expand upon the necessary conditions for Deep Listening."
Both of these sections function to develop a deeper understanding of the complexities of Deep Listening.
"Moreover, both pieces lean on academia to support their conclusions though often through different means."
"Kassabian uses cultural sources and academia around music, film, and sound to provide some nuance to the intellectual topics he approaches, often drawing insight from them or countering their conclusions to support his own."
"In one case, Kassabian refers to Joseph Lanza’s Elevator Music to establish that “ubiquitous musics… are a quintessentially twentieth-century technology” ."
"In another, he expands on Deleuze and Guattari’s conception of Striated and Smooth space to determine that haptics are “closely tied to erotics, to the dissolution of boundaries, to an erosion of self-other distinctions” ."
"Oliveros, on the other hand, uses a range of scientific and cultural works to establish her definitions."
"One scientific source that described how “evoked potentials in the brain appear up to a half-second before the individual is aware of a stimulus” is used to further her point that since “perception in time is an illusion,” consciousness is the act of bringing the past to the present and therefore is inextricably linked with “self-recognition” ."
Tonally Deep Listening and Ubiquitous Listening apply very different approaches as their intended audiences come from very different backgrounds.
Throughout Ubiquitous Listening Kassabian uses an intensely academic tone.
"That is, his writing is heavily relational and almost esoteric."
"This is perhaps best exemplified by one of his sentences referring to the works of Deleuze and Guattari as they relate to that of Marks and Massumi where he states that “The shift away from narrative identification and position draws a renewed focus onto somatic, haptic engagements with music ” ."
This sentence draws on several of his previously explored ideas and utilizes academic terms specific to his subject because his audience is assumed to be of an academic background.
"In contrast, Oliveros is writing to advocate for the public to accept and engage in the practice of Deep Listening in the hopes that they may attend one of her workshops and further their understanding of sound and listening."
"Therefore, much of her writing is more simple, direct, and concise."
"Apart from their rhetoric, Kassabian and Oliveros find many points of conflict and disagreement in their content."
"Firstly, their most obvious point of contention is around the difference  between listening and hearing."
"Fundamentally, their views are opposed on this front as both suggest that listening develops the conception of a self, but they disagree on what that self may consist of and what type of listening, attentive or otherwise, can serve this function."
Kassabian establishes that listening consists of “a range of engagements between and across human bodies and music technologies” and therefore his definition “wipes out… the routine distinction between listening and hearing… in which the presumption is that hearing is physiological and listening is conscious and attentive” .
Oliveros describes the difference between listening and hearing in just the way that Kassabian “wipes out” by stating that she differentiates “‘to hear’ and ‘to listen’.
To hear is the physical means that enables perception.
To listen is to give attention to what is perceived both acoustically and psychologically” .
Kassabian determines that listening can imply any degree of attention while Oliveros draws a hard line between listening with attention and hearing without it.
"In drawing that line, she discards the value of hearing to “self-recognition” as hearing lacks the key feature of consciousness."
Kassabian counter’s this point by establishing that “Identity is a position left behind by the work of affect” which is unrelated to the degree of consciousness.
"As a result of their separate approaches to listening, deep versus ubiquitous, they find themselves again in opposition to each other with respect to the mode of listening."
Kassabian again takes the more holistic stance by suggesting that listening is not dependent on the ear; it is rather dependent on the sum of a number of sensory experiences.
"That is, he thinks of hearing “as a not rigidly differentiated field” ."
"This allows him to come to the conclusion that all things, hearing or deaf, are bound by ubiquitous listening in a distributed subjectivity."
"Oliveros, however, clearly states that “The ear makes it possible to hear and to listen” ."
Her point is made as a result of the fundamental difference between the purposes of Ubiquitous and Deep Listening.
"Since Deep Listening is intended to expand perception rather than expanding the self, it is dependent on the ability to perceive sound aurally."
"
In spite of their differences, Kassabian and Oliveros both determine that their respective ways of hearing expand the mind beyond its previous ability."
"To this end, they agree that perception is influenced by the perceiver's thoughts and experiences — thoughts and experiences that are often a part of a shared subjectivity."
"In defining listening, Oliveros determines that “Sound pressure patterns assist hearing but cultural history and experience influences listening” ."
"Kassabian extends this argument and states that we should “stop analyzing music as an object external to us” rather there is a “large field of subjectivity, neither undifferentiated nor individualized, neither simply individual nor reductively social” that connects us to what we hear ."
"As Jonathan Williger contends in his review of Deep Listening the album, Oliveros similarly advocates for deep listening as a means to connect with the “many vibrational energies throughout the universe.” That is, “To listen is to be aware of one’s self in that collective whole” ."
"Though they may disagree on the modality of listening, they find common ground in its impact to all parts of the body and mind."
"In the practice of Deep Listening, Oliveros emphasizes the importance of “listening to my listening and discerning the effects on my body-mind continuum” ."
"Through Ubiquitous Listening, Kassabian states that there is some affect on the “circuit of bodily responses to stimuli that take place before conscious apprehension” that leaves a residue which “accretes in our bodies, becoming the stuff of future affective responses” ."
"In each case, the authors agree that there is some relationship between sound, body, and mind that alters one’s perception indefinitely."
" 
In combination, Ubiquitous Listening and Deep Listening each present unique opportunities to learn from the sounds and musics we ingest every day."
"As humans, we are surrounded by information that is constantly shifting and developing our identities, but if we take the time to listen — to truly and deeply listen — we can see in the noise of that information who we really are and we can use what we see  to expand our understanding of ourselves as we relate to the greater distributed subjectivity."
"﻿As I understand it, I think of my memory as similar to a data structure called a hashmap."
"That is, when accessing memories, they cannot simply be indexed from 0 , but I need to have a key that points to a reference that stores that memory."
"In many cases, that key is sensual."
"For example, the smell of cigarettes might allow me to more vividly remember when my family and I bought our dog since the breeder’s house was stained with the scent."
"Despite this fact, the memory that my mind associates with the key “my first memory” is of a young, likely three or four year-old, me, having just gotten up from watching Dora and walking towards the door of my family’s first house after being called by my mom."
"Much of this memory is visual and reasoned since the key I have is a linguistic one, but I do remember a feeling of excitement as it may have been the first time I got to see my mom that day."
I can hardly ever remember my dreams unless I quickly make an effort to retain them after waking up.
Writing or dictating my dreams immediately after waking up often allows me to remember more of the dream than I otherwise would have.
"When I do this, I can usually work backwards from where the dream ends by analyzing what got me to that point."
This technique comes with the caveat that whatever series of events that I string together will be a low fidelity representation of the dream.
The only time I truly remember my dreams is within the dream itself or within subsequent dreams that may take place as a continuation of that previous dream.
I have what I would consider to be a rational fear of the dark because of its ability to obscure and conceal potential dangers.
"I find that I am often drawn to paintings that evoke this fear, namely Francisco de Goya’s Pinturas Negras ."
Fear heightens the senses.
"It makes us more keenly aware of the details in a painting, or in the case of darker paintings, it makes us project detail that is obscured."
Fear is a flow state and like any other it inspires creativity.
But creativity born from fear often tends toward the negative which I think appeals to me as much of my creative thought on the day-to-day is born from optimism and therefore my mind yearns for a balance.
﻿A common theme I noticed throughout these readings was the incredible faith that libertarians have for markets to function as both a moral technology and economic power house.
"By extension, there was also a theme of disdain for the over-reaching of governments ."
"To the libertarian, government, as Rothbard expounds upon, is the root of most if not all of the economic problems we face as a society."
"The solution to those problems, therefore, is to establish freed markets in place of inefficient government bureaucracies."
"
I found the way in which libertarians argued around the issue of inequality to be very interesting and almost counterintuitive to the notions I had previously accepted about capitalism."
"Specifically, the Rawlsian concept that it is better to divide up the pie unequally and make a bigger pie than to divide up a smaller pie equally and Chartier’s suggestion that Markets Undermine Privilege challenge what I think to be the traditional idea that capitalism  enshrines inequality and therefore leaves the 90% worse off."
"Johnson engages with this dichotomy head on arguing that capitalism  is the root of such inequalities and therefore the traditional notion holds some water, though only in the case of the statist-allied definition of capitalism."
I am curious to see empirically whether Chartier’s theory of MUP actually applies across the board in the places where government intervention has been entrenched as a societal norm like K-12 education.
﻿Kirk’s laundry list of conservative principles outlines reasonably well a trend I saw across writings from conservative authors.
"That is, these authors tend towards a value system based on a strong sense of morality derived from traditional  and/or religious values, a belief that deviation from the current societal structure can be unstable and dangerous , a desire to limit and regulate central powers, and a will to maintain all rights especially that of property."
"The question of how we as a society should reconcile morality and religious values with the maintenance of capitalism  is explored at length by Kristol, Optiz, Rand, Hayek in his article “The Moral Element of Free Enterprise”, and to some extent, D’Souza."
"All of whom conclude that capitalism and freedom require its constituents to agree on some idea of morality, and though there is some dissension of what that morality would be in the ideal, most of them agree that something is better than nothing."
"Rand and Kristol both find that conservatism, as it stood when they wrote their respective articles, fails to offer any answer as to what this morality should be and therefore it is sowing the seeds of its own demise to more persuasive and less practical ideologies that do offer a moral framework."
"Communism is, as written about by Optiz, innately opposed to conservatism because it denies the existence of the spiritual and seeks to, through revolutionary action, undo the gains made by values derived from the bible and the classical era."
The Heritage Foundation’s list of conservative principles is an especially good example of the conservative’s healthy distrust of central government power as several of its points are based on the idea that individual rights should supersede government control and government control should be limited by the constitution and ideally deferred to local governments before federal.
"﻿I’m drawn to this One Republic song almost entirely because of its use in Top Gun: Maverick, although the way in which it emanates positivity and a sense of nostalgia for summers past influences my attraction to it."
I think any song that I crave to listen to has some connection to a feeling that I am seeking.
"Whether it be a song that represents a calm and warm day spent doing only what I wish to do and nothing more, a song that represents the love of Christmas with family, or a song that represents a good night out."
"That sense of representation can either come from a direct association with the context in which I heard a song the first time or first few times, or it can come from the general vibe of the song if it is constructed well enough."
I think many people connect with music in this way.
"That is, many people are drawn to songs by their ‘vibe.’ If a song resonates with a person’s life experience then that person will enjoy that song
The value of negative criticism can not be seen immediately."
Negative criticism in the few moments after it is released can only serve to make an experience more negative for both the audience and the creator.
Negative criticism derives its value from its capability to improve future art.
"If someone creates a work that is poorly received, the negative criticism they face will inspire them to make slight alterations to their process which may therefore make their next work better."
"If it doesn’t, they can continue to iterate through this process of creation and criticism until it does."
"﻿For fifteen minutes, I sat at my desk in my dorm and listened."
"I listened to the whir of the AC unit, blowing lightly but with a comforting consistency."
"Never faltering, never sputtering, just whirring like a never ending gust of wind."
Then my refrigerator begins to buzz.
Like the buzzing of a mechanical beehive.
"Two tones, a whir and buzz, matching each other in their persistence, creating one unified and beautiful tone."
Then the fan turns on in the hallway.
"A new frequency, but a welcome one."
"It matches the other two, and without ego, it joins them in song."
"
Soon the buzz of the refrigerator dies down, but its song still lingers in my ear."
"It's as though I can still, I hear its part in the trio, but it's no longer substantial."
"Some phenomenon of the mind has maintained its buzz, as though I am trying to hold on to the memory of the harmony it once made."
The fan outside soon turns itself off and I am left with just the whir of my AC unit.
It feels lonely.
Wanting for its partners.
"But they have given up, and will not rejoin it for some time."
I notice chatter outside but it is muffled by the walls into vague and rhythmic hums.
"
The AC unit turns on, now bellowing angrily."
Its noise demands all attention.
It covers its competitors and tries to blow them away.
"Then there is a click, as the motor quickly repents for its outburst and returns to a gentle whir."
"For a moment, though there is no hope of silence, there is at least peace."
Everything is as it should be.
"
But more voices disturb the stability."
I hear and feel a flurry of movement at the end of the hall.
Steps.
"No, stomps reverberate so deeply and shake my room so fully that they might well have come from my own feet."
"In my fifteen minutes, I noticed that there is not much variation in the sounds of my dorm."
"Whirs, buzzes, muffled voices, and the occasional bout of movement, but not much exceeding those."
"I noticed that there is rarely stability, but the instability is always predictable."
"The loudest noises come from within my room, particularly when the AC unit turns its fan on."
The softest audible noises come from the AC units outside of my room.
"﻿I was surprised to see the wide range of how each religion can be interpreted as either morally justifying, and in the case of Christianity fundamental to, capitalism or it can be interpreted as antithetical to capitalism rejecting almost every feature of its morality."
"For Christianity, evidence of the former can be found in the reading about The Protestant Ethic and in Micheal Novak’s response to the question “Has capitalism become incompatible with christianity?’ Evidence of the latter is Pope Francis’s comments about markets and inequality and Salsman's essay about the Christianity and the welfare state."
"My personal belief after these readings is that Catholicism appears to be diametrically opposed to the morality of capitalism in almost every respect whereas Protestantism, specifically Puritanism, has at least some moral justifications for capitalism as a vehicle to promote work ethic, asceticism, and success, as said by Weber, and in my opinion, to promote integrity and honesty."
"Ultimately, I believe that Christianity’s internal conflict with the capitalist system that creates so much wealth and yet so much inequality has, as argued by Salsman, led to a middle ground for many Christians politically to support some form of a welfare state."
"I know very little about Islam and sharia law so, after the readings, I was surprised to find that at least Sorman contends that Islam is morally accepting of many foundational facets of capitalism like entrepreneurship and seeking wealth without guilt."
"The restrictions on joint-stock companies, the dispersion of inheritance, and the prohibition of interest seem to me to be no more serious hampers on capitalism than the laws and morality dictated by Christianity."
" It makes sense, therefore, that Sorman blames the shoddy state of capitalism on tyrannical and unstable governments established after decolonization more so than sharia law."
"﻿As someone who is generally optimistic about capitalism, I am inclined to believe that capitalism and the environment are not fundamentally opposed to each other."
"However, it is hard to ignore the impact that humans have had on the climate simply by virtue of the energy and resources required to fuel innovation and increasing standards of living and arguments such as Schwartz’s and Foster’s seem to establish an inherent conflict between natural interests and human interests."
"From a simply human-centric perspective, Epstein and Shellenberger make convincing arguments that we will be able to withstand and adapt to changes in the environment as they come, whether they are caused by us or otherwise."
"However, human life is not my only concern as it relates to the environment."
"I think, contrary to some of the readings, that maintaining the beauty of the natural world is equally as important as maintaining and improving human life."
"While I do agree with Epstien’s assertion that we will find better, cleaner, and cheaper ways to fuel our economic growth, I must also admit that we, as a species, have wrought much ecological damage already seeking that ever present goal and because of this fact I believe that there should be bounds in place to restrain the negative externalities of capitalist fervor."
"Calls to violently overthrow capitalism so as to mitigate its environmental harm seem, to me, short sighted at best and self-contradictory at worst."
"As Schwartz asserts in his article, “Man survives only by altering nature to satisfy his own needs.” I don’t believe this will change simply by virtue of a new economic system."
A communist government would chop down the Amazon rainforest for more collectivized cattle farms as easily as a capitalist economy would chop it down for private ones.
"Moreover, revolutionary socialists like Street seem to ignore the potential for massive environmental damage that a violent revolution may incur despite many criticisms of the environmental harm done by imperialist wars."
"Ultimately, I reject the idea that an inclination towards capitalism and a desire to maintain the earth's ecology are fundamentally at odds as capitalism has the potential for infinite recursive improvements upon itself that leave open the possibility for more sustainable and more efficient energy, resource attainment, and agricultural practices."
"Before those changes revolutionize our world, however, I think it necessary to ensure that our most valuable ecosystems are protected and, unfortunately, the only entities with the resources to ensure that protection are governments."
"﻿In one of my classes last semester, a phrase said by Ruth Wilson Gilmore has really nagged at me as I consider myself generally pro-free-market but also anti-racist."
"In a video entitled, “Geographies of Racial Capitalism,” Gilmore asserted that “Capitalism requires inequality and racism enshrines it.” Taken separately, I don’t think either of these claims are particularly objectionable but together I think the implication that capitalism therefore enshrines racism certainly, at least to some degree, is."
"We have seen capitalism, essentially defined by Kendi as the freedom to exploit those with less money than you, perpetuate some form of societal racial discrimination essentially since its conception and especially so in America against black people."
"If that is truly what capitalism is, I think I would have to be forced to agree with Gilmore."
"However, other definitions of capitalism challenge this notion."
"The ‘crony capitalism’ that people like Dixon criticize, I argue, is the sort of capitalism that Gilmore and Kendi despise, and rightly so."
"Many pro-capitalist thinkers also hold this breed of capitalism in contempt, but I think their solutions may hold more water when it comes to being ‘anti-racist.’ Riesman makes the simple yet compelling argument that capitalism, as defined by a system of free markets protected by a limited government, is inherently opposed to discrimination and differentiation on the basis of anything other than an individual’s productivity since that's all markets will care about."
"Though I agree with Kendi’s suggestions to improve poverty via a universal social safety net and advocate for a “progressive capitalism,” I do not think any of his proposed policies will make any progress in solving racism."
They may improve the lives of those who live in dire situations but they will not break down systemic inequalities hardened by many years of traditional thinking.
"As Ann Cudd argues, only capitalism can do that."
"﻿The 1981 World Bank Report argues for growth oriented policies in the agricultural sector like the privatization of farms, reforming price controls on agricultural goods, and investment in agricultural research of Sub-Saharan Africa."
Many if not all of their solutions involve greater privatization and less government interventions.
Anecdotal and statistical data from throughout the African continent is presented to support these capitalist reforms with the apparent hope that they will inspire some development in the industry.
"
Bamako explores how ex-colonial powers have held down and stolen from Africa even in the post-colonial era."
"Similar to Kauonui’s argument about settler colonialism, neo-colonialism in Africa is shown to be a structure maintained by Western powers."
"While the structure of neo-colonialism in post-colonial Africa is not intended towards genocide, it has, similar to settler colonialism, functioned as a tool for the exploitation of their land."
"
Before watching Bamako and before Monday’s lecture, I held the misconception that much if not all of Africa’s economic falters resulted simply from corruption and ineffective governance after decolonization destabilized the continent."
"While these factors may have played a role in this, I was unaware of the West’s imposition of structural adjustment and the significant part it had in much of Africa’s suffering."
﻿Hickey believes that art is intrinsically without value but can derive value from the sum of public opinion and interpretation surrounding it .
Tarkovsky similarly believes that art derives its purpose and therefore its value from the consumer .
Hickey establishes that he believes that the art world defines the value of art.
"In doing so, it “conducts an ongoing referendum on how things should look and the way we should look at things” ."
"Tarkovsky expresses a similar idea, in that art defines its value through its ability to “explain to the artist himself and to those around him what man lives for, what is the meaning of his existence” ."
The two are alike in their thought that art finds its worth through its capability to reflect and represent the human experience.
The key difference between them is that Tarkovsky gives agency to the art itself as it defines its own value and Hickey removes that agency and instead ascribes it solely to the audience.
﻿Each of the reviewer’s expectations were defined by the greatness of the previous movie.
"They both acknowledged how the previous movie maintained a strong narrative even in moments where it may have also been doing service to the Marvel franchise, a characteristic both reviewers feel the new Black Panther movie could not replicate."
"Moreover, they both touch on how the script at times could limit the actors performances more so than it did in the previous film."
"Ultimately, they come to similar conclusions with regard to their criteria based on the original Black Panther film: this movie was a faithful sequel but a flawed one at that."
Both the Little White Lies article and the New Yorker article assume their reader has some knowledge of superhero movies and the Marvel franchise specifically.
Bunsie mentions the term “Phase 4” a term specific to the MCU that only Marvel fans/viewers would recognize and  Brody that the reader has at least seen the first Black Panther film as much of his evaluation is based on it.
These reviews use the bare minimum of description in their evaluation introducing only the initial characters and their initial relationship to each other.
Many of their evaluations do not criticize specific moments in the plot or developments in any of the characters  rather they tend to evaluate thematic successes and failures.
The New Yorker ventures into the realm of evaluating developments but only with the movie's introductory events and nothing beyond that.
Each of the reviews show just enough of the story to get their reader thinking about what certain plot points may mean but not enough to reveal the story at large as they generally only reveal the bare minimum necessary for their evaluation.
﻿Okihiro argues that the black power movement in the US emerged as a consequence of the Third World liberation movements and the discourse around anti-colonialism .
"Moreover, he asserts that the Third World liberation movement has roots in racialized politics which made its impact on black power all the more relevant ."
He points to the Black Panthers as they considered the US government to be a colonizing force and African Americans as colonial subjects .
"As Cesaire speaks on the decivilizing force of colonization and refers to Nazism as an extension of colonialism, Moyn describes the Western human rights movement as a reaction to World War II ."
"Therefore, as Cesaire might argue, human rights was a reaction to colonialism and the movement occured because of Nazism's relationship to colonialism."
"Though I have read much about domestic politics in modern Chinese history, I never associated the rise of China under Mao with the global collective liberation movement in the post-WWII era."
"Moreover, I knew of China's distaste for the two powers of the Cold War but I had not considered that this sentiment might have inspired China's role in the emergence of third world alliances ."
﻿Berger refers to a ‘language of images’ as the use of art and other visuals as a form of or supplement to communication.
Images - like words - have no authority of their own but form a powerful force for expression when used as a language.
"Today, that language of images is most accurately embodied in memes."
"The culture around memes, today, sways public discourse and has become an essential tool in the expression of public sentiment."
"I, like most of us who exist in the presence of social media, have become as literate as one can try to be in memes, but their transience makes complete literacy an impossibility."
Memes and other images surround us on the Internet and often make their way into day to day conversations over text.
Literacy in the ‘language of images’ can skew how we interpret art of the past if we approach that art as language.
It can reduce art to a message.
A means to end in communication.
But I try to avoid assigning meanings to works of art from both the past and present.
There is a sharp distinction between art and images of language.
"Though one can at times be the other, art conveys an experience - images of language convey a meaning."
"﻿The field of modern economics, developed to model the activities of a capitalist system, assumes that all participants in a market are rational."
"I think it would be far-fetched to say that all people in capitalist systems always behave rationally and with their own self-interest in mind, but capitalism and economics developed a system of reason that gives each of its participants a guide to act in a ‘reasonable’ manner that is promoted via self interest."
Therefore there is at least some defensible claim to say that capitalism is a “system of the mind” as it establishes a doctrine to describe reason .
"As Galbraith describes it, capitalism is a way to effectively decentralize economic decision making on a large scale."
"As its success relies on its distributions of actors striving to find economic success through its system of reason, I think it is fair to call this a system of the head since it requires and promotes the activity of many brains thinking and acting within reason and with ingenuity."
"Most historians seem to agree that capitalism, if not natural in itself, is rooted in human nature, particularly in the realms of desire for acquisition of wealth, competition, and the pursuit of happiness."
"Some may feel that these inclinations are solely self-serving and therefore dangerous to promote in the human condition, others that these inclinations are paramount to the fulfilling our desire for self-actualization, and others still may argue that the economic actions taken within capitalism are not grounded in morality but are instead grounded in reason so they should not be included in one's moral evaluation of oneself."
"For the most part , elements of humanism emerge from both pro-capitalists and anti-capitalists."
Pro-capitalists often seem to be of the opinion that capitalism improves the average living standard over time so therefore it is a positive system.
Anti-capitalist often seem to be of the opinion that capitalism is a blight on the working people as it enshrines their exploitation.
"Anti-humanism too, is a feature of each camp’s ideology."
That is  pro-capitalists believe in exploitation for the purpose of beating the competition and  anti-capitalists hold much disdain for the individuality that capitalism allows in its constituents.
"
One of the most interesting ideas I found in these readings was the concept that we may no longer live in a capitalist America."
Not only as a result of increasing government intervention but also as a result of markets developing away from the structures and cycles prescribed by Marx.
"Rather, as Sombart, Smith and Fulcher describe, we live in an epoch of late capitalism characterized by the spread of industrialization around the world and the increasing expansion of financial capitalism and enterprises, like Apple, that are no longer industrial and cannot be classified by the traditional Marxist definition of capitalist enterprises."
"Despite these changes from its original classification, however, I think capitalism still has the spirit of ‘economic individualism,’ though this economic individualism is now extended to ventures that are not focused on hard capital."
"
"
"﻿Packer, Rand, Buchanan and Mises all seem to agree that capitalism is a system built for the independent minded, the self-assured, and the rugged individualist."
"To be certain, these characteristics are commonly seen amongst those who do succeed within capitalism and therefore there is some argument to be made that these characteristics are promoted within capitalism."
"Moreover, as Packer illustrates in her speech, the prerequisites to success within capitalism are also pre-requisites to lasting happiness."
"I would argue, along with Rand, that key similarity between all of these features as they relate to capitalism is their connection to self-interest."
"
Self-interest is the primary motive for economic reason within capitalism and that has had many downstream effects on the psychology of its constituents."
"Self-interest takes many forms – social, financial, material, psychological, spiritual, etc."
"– and often, if it does not harm or exploit others, a beneficial motivator for an individual."
Self-interest precipitates self-responsibility which allows people to derive greater and more meaningful satisfaction from the lives they live.
"However, to structure a society entirely around self-interest can lead to social isolation, failures to attend to dire situations which do not directly benefit the attender, and systemic distortions of what is truly in one's own self-interest ."
Buchanan believes that any desire for distributionist socialism is derived from an insecurity of one’s own ability to take responsibility for themselves.
"I would argue, on the contrary, that distributionist leanings often seek to address the negative externalities of a system designed entirely around self-interest as well as to offset some of its more negative psychological consequences."
"
Capitalistic self-interest promotes some of the psychological prerequisites for happiness, but it can also penalize other necessities for happiness like family time, leisure, and community among those rugged individualists who do not have the good grace of enough wealth to slow down for a moment."
"As we saw in Sandel’s article, there are some parts of the human experience that are not amenable to the free market and these can and will be eroded under capitalism if and when markets are given the chance to find their way into them."

﻿Cesaire asserts that the process of colonization functions not only to dehumanize the colonized but to decivilize the colonizer.
This includes but is not limited to all of the people who profit from or indulge in the profits of colonialism.
"He points to Nazism as a natural extension of the colonial system since the utter brutality of the Nazis within Europe could only have developed in a culture that accepts, and in some cases advocates for, such terrible brutality outside of Europe."
"
As ""Imagined Communities"" explores the foundations of a nation, Williams and Chrisman explore how the very conception of a colonial nation erases the culture of the natives that were displaced."
"Not only does it destroy native culture, but in impressing upon the natives the process of developing a nation’s consciousness, colonizers will reinforce ideas of racialized cultures so as to confuse any cohesive justifications for the native people's nationhood."
"While Cesaire introduced to me the concept of decivilization as an externality of colonialism, it was not until I saw the scenes of colonial violence and its consequences in Concerning Violence that I realized the raw truth of this statement."
"In this film, we see colonizers who twist their minds to morally justify colonialism and we see freedom fighters pushed to brutality."
"I had known that colonialism decivilized the colonizer, but I had never thought that it functioned to decivilize the native as well."
"﻿Lee argues that the Fu Manchu mustache functioned synecdochally to represent many misconceptions about the Chinese and, more broadly, Southeast Asians most prominently representing the threat of the 'yellow peril' to white civilization."
"Dating back to Early Modern European plays, Asia was often cast as a terrible, invading force from the East ."
"When the mandarin mustache replaced turbans and scimars to indicate anything Oriental, it similarly became associated with the menacing characters that often were themselves representative of the threat of Asia ."
"Building on the perspective of Dunbar-Ortiz, Said expands on America's identity as a settler colonial nation by highlighting its expansionary colonial tendencies."
"The war in Iraq, for example, used similar justifications for foreign intervention as colonial powers did in their invasions of Africa and the Americas ."
"America, however, subtly but distinctly frames its actions as 'the spread of democracy' rather than 'the spread of modernity’
In Lee’s presentation, there was a brief mention of the ‘fox eye’ as a trend in makeup derived from the natural features of Southeast Asians."
"I have seen this style before on celebrities and amongst internet star’s, most if not all of them white, but I did not connect it to the Asian eye it quite obviously seeks to imitate."
"This, along with several other examples, forced me to reevaluate the extent to which Asian culture is appropriated and misused even today."
"﻿As of now, I support capitalism over any other form of societal governance, but acknowledging its many blind spots, I am in favor of a more mixed system that can address the failure cases of capitalism."
"Capitalism is an endlessly turning wheel that drives us each day towards greater technological advancements increasing the standard of living for everyone, regardless of class, at an exponential rate."
Capitalism is incredibly dynamic and adaptable as it is guided by the demands of its constituents.
"That being said, capitalism also produces massive amounts of waste, encourages negative externalities like climate change, and enshrines inequity."
"For such instances as these, I believe there must be a body that limits the extent to which capitalism can function counter to our interests."
The confusion I have as it relates to my own political philosophy is how much a governing entity should limit capitalism so as to maximize its dynamism and innovation as well as minimizing its externalities.
"
As my position on mixed-capitalism is far from set in stone, I am certain that my opinions of the system will develop at least slightly and they may perhaps develop beyond recognition."
I am greatly opposed to the combination of capital and government  so I can see myself changing my perspective on capitalism if I am convinced beyond any doubt that “crony capitalism”  is inevitable in a mixed system.
"
In my journey for towards a more concrete personal political philosophy, I believe it to be paramount that I analyze as many of the proposed societal systems as possible and in taking this class, I hope to gain a deep knowledge of at least capitalism and perhaps at least a shallower understanding of its peers (ie."
"socialism, communism, anarchism, etc.)"
"﻿Thrasher argues that settler colonial structures dating back to the forceful immigration of slaves to America have, throughout history, enforced and relied on the sickness of black populations in order to maintain the health of the white population ."
"For example in the COVID-19 pandemic, disproportionately black and brown essential workers were exposed to the virus while disproportionately white populations were able to keep the virus at a socially distant length ."
"As the Critical Polyamorist explores how America’s puritan traditions and antiquated ideas of morality have molded systems to dissuade alternative lifestyles, Thrasher finds that these structures are often exacerbated, if not created, by the neoliberal capitalist tendency to deliver power to the ruling class at the expense of the oppressed and to marginalize minority groups as a means of distracting from this concentration of power ."
"
I recently heard a comedian question why white people invaded so many countries for their spices, only to avoid spices in their own food."
"I identified with this question, especially considering I have white English grandparents who often make bland, spiceless food."
Ghosh suggests that there was a shift in the taste of upper class Europeans away from spices as they became associated with a poor moral fiber .

"Kelly’s The Proletariat Goes to College, the argument is made that unions, especially those at universities, “need to adopt a broad vision of social justice to succeed” because the labor pool that universities pull from is largely black, brown, recently immigrated, and/or female."
"Moreover, many of the labor disputes they have fought for are inextricably linked to the ‘isms’ that oppress them."
"The day after the death of Dr. King, a protest was organized at Duke for increased pay, a grievance committee, and the resignation of the president from an all white country club."
"Unfortunately, the many marginalized communities that fought for these goals were defeated by the university and their union was left “was in shambles” ."
"Furthermore, Yale officials justified “draconian policies toward dining-hall and custodial workers precisely because… [those jobs were] associated with black labor” ."
This is to say that the fight for better working conditions at universities is compounded with many other ongoing fights for dignity in marginalized communities.

These ideas speak to the culturally destructive force of great powers in their need to establish a cultural continuity as capitalism seeks to reach homogeneity for the sake of trade.

Typically, I am amenable to the thought that capitalism can be a force for social mobility amongst countries, but Thompson’s essay brings up a strong base of evidence that the kind of social mobility capitalism offers to developing countries may not be worth the trouble."

"﻿Marx’s definition of capitalism, or at least my approximation derived from all the readings, is that it is a system developed out of feudal societies as their replacement which rested private property from the hands of the aristocracy, into the hands of the bourgeois."
This system places immense value on capital.
"More specifically, it focuses its energies on increasing the profit that capital has the potential to produce."
Class divisions emerge as a result of a person’s relationship to capital since there are those who own the capital and the means of its production opposed to those who simply labor alongside the means of production to create profit for the owners.
"As it relates to labor, capitalism extracts as much productive value out of them for the lowest cost to achieve the highest profit margins."
"The essence of the Marxist critique, therefore, is that society should not value capital more than it values itself."
"To go further, the essence of the critique is that private property has corrupted the human condition."
"
Marx praises the ability of capitalism, practically, to produce and innovate through rapid development of the means of production and its incredible potential to self-replicate around the world creating sprawling and impossibly complex social markets, but he critiques the impersonal machines that are established alongside these development which use labor simply as another factor in the means of production."
"
One can draw several connections between arguments against commercialism  and Marx’s belief in transcendence from private property."
"As was illustrated in Dworkin’s and Sandel’s essays, the arguments about the anti-social consequence of markets and bourgeois private-property within society are derived from Marxist thought."
"A society in which we connect solely to what we have, they all argue, is a society which prevents us from connecting to each other."
"﻿This week's readings, in combination, aptly dismantled every aspect of Marxism and even undid some of his criticisms of capitalism."
"Through many of the readings, I found myself agreeing with people whose broader political philosophies far from align with my own on the merit of their critiques of Marx."
"For instance, Rand paints a dreary picture of a factory governed by one of Marx’s more utopian ideals that I saw as insightful and quite damning for Marx."
"She represents the skewed reward systems of “for each according to his ability, to each according to his need” faithfully to my own experience with human nature."
"Though as Thompson points out, “Metaphysically, [Marxism] seeks to change human nature itself” and Marx might argue that this policy would only be in place once “labor has become not only a mean, of life, but also the highest want in life,” even if extra work were perceived as a reward to the ideal Marxist laborer, there would certainly still be many people who Rand calls the “shiftless and irresponsible” that slip through the cracks of Marx’s moral reconstruction, who would drain the life blood of production for their own personal gain."
"Moreover, I have seen no evidence that human nature can ever be changed so much as to dissuade unscrupulous actors from seeking the absolute power that Marxism grants the state."
"These people are represented by the Starnes siblings in Rand’s allegory  and referred to at length in Hayek’s essay “Why the Worst Get on Top.”

The connection between socialism and Nazism made by Hayek was novel to me and yet seemed quite natural when it was explained."
"That being said, by my understanding of socialism and socialist thought, any socialist of any degree  would likely consider Nazism to be a perversion of the ideals that socialism represents."
"Beginning with Nazism's separation from the international and focus on nationalism, to the Nazi’s subjugation of a single racial group, and to their desire for violence beyond that of the revolutionary kind."
"﻿Change: My confidence level, with respect to writing, has increased dramatically by at least a point and a half ."
"I think I now am confident in my ability to produce larger essays than I have ever written previously with a high quality within a relatively short period of time, given enough focus and attention on the essay."
"Moreover, I have learned to become especially confident with my ability to write analysis and synthesis as that is something I’ve come to enjoy and find a greater appreciation for over the course of this class."
I feel like I’ve shaken off any rust that may have grown in my gap year and I’m more prepared to write academically and more generally communicate effectively through writing.
Takeaways: I think I have certainly improved my academic writing style by focusing specifically on organization and tangible methods of engaging an audience through writing.
"Though, I’m not certain if I have achieved the abstract goal of being able to convey my character in a text , I think I’ve certainly attained skills that move me closer to that goal."
Engaging points of the class: I enjoyed writing in various formats throughout this class.

"﻿Scott redesigns the epistemological framework fed to us by state controlled societies of nomadic, ungoverned peoples as those left over from ancient societies by telling their history as one of an intentional rejection of the coercive advances of modern civilizations and cultures ."
"As seen in the cultures in Zomia, many trace their origins back to flight from the instability and exploitation of the Burman, Tai, and Siamese states and from the Han Empire during its expansionary phases ."
A re-evaluation of this region as a modern society that consciously rejects ‘civilization’ reframes the arguments for their integration as punitive and rapacious.
"Scott addresses the two powers of the non-elite as their capability for flight, as he expands on in his book, and to fight ."
Federici calls for the latter in an effort to reshape capitalism .
"As flight is an immediate remedy to the pilfering of self-actualization by the state, Federici sees revolt as a long-term solution to eradicate the exploitative tendencies of capitalism."
"In the case of Germany, according to my understanding of my European history class,  I was under the impression that it had a strong, ancient cultural history that bound together the confederacy it once was that simply was not expanded upon in class."

﻿Brooks’s review of Prince’s Controversy judges the album by its ability to challenge the boundaries of society and by the breadth and depth of the defiant statements made by each song.
"Moreland’s review of Taylor Swift’s Midnights, however, judges the album largely by its relationship to Swift herself and also, to a lesser degree, by its relationship to the audience."
Many of Moreland’s criticisms center about a song's inability to reflect an authentic feel from Swift within the music.
The two critics do find common ground in their criteria as they evaluate both Swift and Prince on the musical resonance of each song either with its message or with the social and/or emotional affect of its words.
"Both reviewers cater towards pop audiences, Moreland more so than Brooks."
Moreland constantly makes references to contemporary pop phenomena which indicates some assumption that the audience is at least aware of these people and pop eras.
Brooks writes about a piece of pop/rock/R&B history so her subject matter naturally caters to the pop fan.
Her writing also indicates a preference towards an audience with generally liberal views as many of the points by which she praises Prince are about his ability to upheave traditional conservative values.
"
Moreland, ultimately, seems to have been a fan of Swift's latest release, but she acknowledges that there were several songs that she would consider to be misses."
"She sees this album as another step in the evolution of Taylor Swift, but considers its execution to be at times jarring or disconnected."
Moreland presents the album as it relates to Taylor and as it relates to you and therefore she implicitly indicates that the audience should judge it by the affect of its resonance.
" Brooks seems to hold Controversy in high regard as she praises every song she mentions, and in the end, she views the album as a massive success in its intended purpose."
Brooks presents the piece as an immensely impactful work of art that was ahead of its time and should be considered as a historical masterpiece.
"As a reader, I think the reviews will add to my criteria as I listen to these albums."
"Each review does not stray too far from evaluation towards interpretation, so I think they were both successful in their central purposes."
"That is, they were both successful in enlightening the successes and failures of each facet of their respective albums."
"Given the overwhelmingly positive response to Swift's album, Moreland’s seven was initially quite jarring, but I think based on the review, it was adequately justified."
The rating functioned to engage me in her writing as I wondered what her criticisms might be that would reduce the score to a seven.
I thought Brooks’s nine was largely unnecessary as his article was simply an appreciation of a past work and did not seem to critically evaluate it on its listening merit.
"The nine was certainly justified in her praise of the work, but again, it seemed quite unnecessary."
"﻿As others have mentioned before me, the readings this week dived much further into Keynes’s economic criticism of capitalism and his prescription to ‘save’ it."
Central to many of the arguments made against Keynes  was the idea that it unjustly threw out established economic theory that is foundational to classical and laissez-faire economics only to replace those theories with new ones that deviate even further from reality.
"Salsman argues that, in disregarding Say’s Law, Keynesian economics is effectively baseless because Keynes is prescribing a solution to a problem  that, in effect, does not really exist within the workings of capitalism."
"Rueff also heavily criticized the Keynesian misrepresentation of aggregate demand and the “liquidity preference” arguing that the market forces will not allow aggregate supply to create significant excess because the price mechanism will motivate actors within a capitalist system to work in areas for which there is greater demand and, to the latter point, that the preference to hold cash is dynamically determined by the participants in a market and therefore does not have a fixed impact on the money supply."
"Simpson makes the argument that Keynes charges the liquidity preference with being the cause of economic depressions, when in reality that relationship is the other way around."
Inflationary expansion promotes spending and contractions in the economy promote saving according to Simpson.
"Moreover, he argues that saving is, counter to Keynes’s beliefs, actually beneficial to an economy as it is closely tied with greater economic stability."
"All of the criticisms of Keynes’s economic theory were from the capitalist position which argued, explicitly or implicitly, in favor of a freer market and against any socialist interventions as those interventions would have downstream consequences that the market could handle without supervision or excessive regulation."
"﻿Much of what we read consisted of Keynes’s moral criticism of capitalism and of communism, but it was quite interesting to note how much these criticisms have changed the economies we exist in today."
"Moreover, Keynes’s distaste towards the “money motive”  was surprising to me as his contribution to the economic system, to the extent of my knowledge at least, does little to fundamentally alter what seems to be his biggest gripe with capitalism."
"He went so far as to describe the instinct as “a somewhat disgusting morbidity,” but explained the inconsistency between his moral qualms and economic suggestions by stating later in his Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren that “Avarice and usury and precaution must be our gods for a little longer still” until we can afford to be rid of them."
"Therefore, despite his disdain for the morality produced by capitalism, he believes that this morality is necessary until the system has compounded enough such that the needs of everyone can be provided for."
"
Before these readings, I had known Keynes primarily in the context of the economic policies that are employed to control the boom-bust cycle, but I was not aware of his affinity towards protectionist policies."
"In the context of his time, this sentiment is intuitive as the world was facing the immense instability of a post World War economy and recent experience had shown that global markets could just as easily pull down a country’s economy as it had pushed them up."
"In his National Self-Sufficiency he explores the moral reasoning for protectionist policies  as well as the practical concluding that a self-sufficient nation is more free, more peaceful, and more in control of its own fate than a nation who relies too much on global markets and production."
﻿Dunbar-Ortiz pushes against the presentation of America as a country of immigrants suggesting that the phrase removes the responsibility from the country’s settler-colonial history since “immigrants join existing polities whereas settlers create new ones”  White America’s eagerness to declare the native American nations of North America ‘dead’ and self-indigenize as the native population are just a few of the settler habits that prevent this from simply being a nation of immigrants .
"Ghosh references how the story of an alleged conspiracy to overthrow Dutch ending in the execution of several Englishmen in Amboyna was twisted as a ‘massacre’ by the despicable Dutch, and through the power of print, the narrative of a British victimhood was accepted influencing the English takeover of New Amsterdam ."
"Anderson’s concept of print capitalism evidently is not only a force for nation building, but by manipulating the collective consciousness it can inspire those nations to colonial expansion."
"
Though I am ashamed of my ignorance, I understood the fate of the native American nations of North America to be largely caused by the fact that they did not have any resistance to European disease and thought that direct British violence only played a relatively small role in their genocide."
I was never presented with a case against immunological determinism nor the extent to which the Europeans facilitated the spread and deadliness of the disease through the pressure they applied both directly and indirectly .
"﻿On move-in-day, I saw that my dorm room could be described generously as a walk-in closet, but just a few weeks before, I had ordered a queen sized bed."
"Having seen my room, a bed any larger than what I had been given would engulf all of what little space I had to myself."
"The bed was due to be moved the day after next, but it had to be canceled and ideally I would receive a refund."
"With no phone number available, I resorted to email."
"I was aware that the employee on the other end of my message, likely has no passion for the rigid dogma that defines the structure of almost every email so I favored a more informal and lighthearted tone, though I was sure to be direct with my intentions."
"After all, I did not want to waste anyone's time."
"Shortly after my initial email, I received a response asking if I would prefer to order a full size bed and specifying that it would only be 16 inches wider than a twin XL."
"I declined the offer on the grounds that my room was already “only a little more than 16 inches wide.” After saying this, I received the refund accompanied by an email confirming my cancellation."
How much of this success was due to my own innovative strategy and how much was due to store policy is up to your interpretation.
﻿My own evaluation and those displayed in both articles align and diverge in many ways.
Richard Brody’s article heavily criticizes the nostalgic gaze of the film and its refusal to address the systemic issues of 1960's Hollywood.
"In the sense that I think the movie is heavily opinionated about the subject matter, I think Brody captured the outward ideologies of Tarantino's guiding hand well, though at times he could be a bit reductive."
The narrative of the movie humanizes the characters through their many flaws to subtly dictate that even this idealized Hollywood is composed of many fallible actors .
I agree with Brody that it is a period piece shown through rose colored glasses and ultimately presents a golden age of Hollywood and dreams of its persistence.
That is not to say that the film fails to criticize The Golden Age as Brody suggests it does.
"The article at one point makes note of Tarantino’s insistence on using racial slurs implying that the racism of the film’s characters are aligned with the racist gaze of the film, however I think Tarantino’s use of vulgar language and images is always to challenge the audiences faith in his protagonists with their crude barbarism."
Joe Morgenstern’s review thoroughly enjoyed watching the film through Tarantino’s lens.
"I think Morgenstern bought into Tarantino's gaze and therefore was along for a much smoother ride, but also was unable to view some of the more jarring moments in the film through his own eyes as I think Tarantino intends."
I also thought that this review perhaps did not appreciate the theme of great figures as those who are the most deserving of pity since it focuses quite heavily on the grandeur of this film’s characters.
Brody’s criteria are not met as he places emphasis on the importance of exploring multiple perspectives while Tarantino’s film heavily favors just one.
"Morgenstern’s criteria are met as he was looking for a movie led by charming front-men that eloquently delivers a fun, funny, extravagant, and well-polished experience."
The WSJ article clearly favors the casual movie-goer looking to watch something fun.
Morgenstern’s praise for the overtones of the narrative and its execution inform my thought that his audience is simply looking for an immersive and engaging experience.
"The New Yorker article, however, focuses more heavily on issues of identity surrounding the film which leads me to believe they are writing for a more progressive and culturally sensitive audience."
Brody’s appeals to disdain for Tarentino’s racially biased gaze correlate most strongly with progressive thought therefore I believe that was his intended demographic.
I lie somewhere in the middle of the two audiences.
"I think it's necessary to apply many perspectives to this film after its conclusion so you can perhaps understand it and its relationship to your identity more deeply, but also I believe it is necessary to accept the experience you are given when you first watch the movie."
"As a fan of the movie, the Metacritic score assigned to the New Yorker article made me immediately defensive and less inclined to assign value to this review, but after reading the author's perspective I gained an appreciation for the nuance in it."
"I was initially more amenable to the WSJ article since its Metacritic score more closely resembled the score I would have given the movie, but ultimately I found the article to oversimplify the film even relative to Brody’s more critical review."
I think the New Yorker review can at times seek to 'change' the work by assigning meaning to its gaze.
"It refers to how a Tarantino movie always ""says—and says and says—what’s on his mind"" and goes on to frame the piece as simply fantasy."
"I don’t think this portion of his review is in service to the work as it does not add anything to the experience of the film, but it seeks to change the experience by placing its own lens over it."
"Morgenstern’s article on the other hand is much more focused on what made the film what it was, therefore I would say his review served the film."
"﻿On Sunday, the newest episode of the Game of Thrones prequel, House of Dragons, came out and it was dark."
The centerpiece of the episode was a dying king struggling to put together his family as it falls apart as a result of his failures in life.
"Death was ever present in the episode, not in the sense that people were constantly dying, but death was always around the corner for the king and it was grim to see him fight weakly against it."
"
My break was not raucous with music as much of it was spent attempting to focus, but I did get the chance to listen to some of my old playlists in the car with my girlfriend."
"These songs made me feel vaguely nostalgic for a time now gone, but more so glad that I had moved forward from that time ."

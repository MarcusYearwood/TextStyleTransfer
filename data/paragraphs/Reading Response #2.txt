Scott redesigns the epistemological framework fed to us by state controlled societies of nomadic, ungoverned peoples as those left over from ancient societies by telling their history as one of an intentional rejection of the coercive advances of modern civilizations and cultures (Scott, 35). As seen in the cultures in Zomia, many trace their origins back to flight from the instability and exploitation of the Burman, Tai, and Siamese states and from the Han Empire during its expansionary phases (Scott, 27). A re-evaluation of this region as a modern society that consciously rejects ‘civilization’ reframes the arguments for their integration as punitive and rapacious.
Scott addresses the two powers of the non-elite as their capability for flight, as he expands on in his book, and to fight (Scott, 33). Federici calls for the latter in an effort to reshape capitalism (Federici, 4-5). As flight is an immediate remedy to the pilfering of self-actualization by the state, Federici sees revolt as a long-term solution to eradicate the exploitative tendencies of capitalism.
In the case of Germany, according to my understanding of my European history class,  I was under the impression that it had a strong, ancient cultural history that bound together the confederacy it once was that simply was not expanded upon in class. From Anderson’s perspective, I now realize that much of that ‘history’ emerged along with print capitalism through works like those of the Brothers Grimm.

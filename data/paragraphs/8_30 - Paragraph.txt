On move-in-day, I saw that my dorm room could be described generously as a walk-in closet, but just a few weeks before, I had ordered a queen sized bed. Having seen my room, a bed any larger than what I had been given would engulf all of what little space I had to myself. The bed was due to be moved the day after next, but it had to be canceled and ideally I would receive a refund. With no phone number available, I resorted to email. I was aware that the employee on the other end of my message, likely has no passion for the rigid dogma that defines the structure of almost every email so I favored a more informal and lighthearted tone, though I was sure to be direct with my intentions. After all, I did not want to waste anyone's time. Shortly after my initial email, I received a response asking if I would prefer to order a full size bed and specifying that it would only be 16 inches wider than a twin XL. I declined the offer on the grounds that my room was already “only a little more than 16 inches wide.” After saying this, I received the refund accompanied by an email confirming my cancellation. How much of this success was due to my own innovative strategy and how much was due to store policy is up to your interpretation.

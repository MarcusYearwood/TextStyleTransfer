Kirk’s laundry list of conservative principles outlines reasonably well a trend I saw across writings from conservative authors. That is, these authors tend towards a value system based on a strong sense of morality derived from traditional (a term that describes slowly changing societal norms) and/or religious values, a belief that deviation from the current societal structure can be unstable and dangerous (and by extension a disdain for revolutionary or utopian systems), a desire to limit and regulate central powers, and a will to maintain all rights especially that of property. The question of how we as a society should reconcile morality and religious values with the maintenance of capitalism (as the prevailing societal structure) is explored at length by Kristol, Optiz, Rand, Hayek in his article “The Moral Element of Free Enterprise”, and to some extent, D’Souza. All of whom conclude that capitalism and freedom require its constituents to agree on some idea of morality, and though there is some dissension of what that morality would be in the ideal, most of them agree that something is better than nothing. Rand and Kristol both find that conservatism, as it stood when they wrote their respective articles, fails to offer any answer as to what this morality should be and therefore it is sowing the seeds of its own demise to more persuasive and less practical ideologies that do offer a moral framework. Communism is, as written about by Optiz, innately opposed to conservatism because it denies the existence of the spiritual and seeks to, through revolutionary action, undo the gains made by values derived from the bible and the classical era. The Heritage Foundation’s list of conservative principles is an especially good example of the conservative’s healthy distrust of central government power as several of its points are based on the idea that individual rights should supersede government control and government control should be limited by the constitution and ideally deferred to local governments before federal.

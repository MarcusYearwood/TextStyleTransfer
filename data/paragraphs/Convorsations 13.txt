In one of my classes last semester, a phrase said by Ruth Wilson Gilmore has really nagged at me as I consider myself generally pro-free-market but also anti-racist. In a video entitled, “Geographies of Racial Capitalism,” Gilmore asserted that “Capitalism requires inequality and racism enshrines it.” Taken separately, I don’t think either of these claims are particularly objectionable but together I think the implication that capitalism therefore enshrines racism certainly, at least to some degree, is. We have seen capitalism, essentially defined by Kendi as the freedom to exploit those with less money than you, perpetuate some form of societal racial discrimination essentially since its conception and especially so in America against black people. If that is truly what capitalism is, I think I would have to be forced to agree with Gilmore. However, other definitions of capitalism challenge this notion. The ‘crony capitalism’ that people like Dixon criticize, I argue, is the sort of capitalism that Gilmore and Kendi despise, and rightly so. Many pro-capitalist thinkers also hold this breed of capitalism in contempt, but I think their solutions may hold more water when it comes to being ‘anti-racist.’ Riesman makes the simple yet compelling argument that capitalism, as defined by a system of free markets protected by a limited government, is inherently opposed to discrimination and differentiation on the basis of anything other than an individual’s productivity since that's all markets will care about. Though I agree with Kendi’s suggestions to improve poverty via a universal social safety net and advocate for a “progressive capitalism,” I do not think any of his proposed policies will make any progress in solving racism. They may improve the lives of those who live in dire situations but they will not break down systemic inequalities hardened by many years of traditional thinking. As Ann Cudd argues, only capitalism can do that.

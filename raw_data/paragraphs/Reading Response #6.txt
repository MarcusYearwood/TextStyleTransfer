Cesaire asserts that the process of colonization functions not only to dehumanize the colonized but to decivilize the colonizer. This includes but is not limited to all of the people who profit from or indulge in the profits of colonialism. He points to Nazism as a natural extension of the colonial system since the utter brutality of the Nazis within Europe could only have developed in a culture that accepts, and in some cases advocates for, such terrible brutality outside of Europe. 
As "Imagined Communities" explores the foundations of a nation, Williams and Chrisman explore how the very conception of a colonial nation erases the culture of the natives that were displaced. Not only does it destroy native culture, but in impressing upon the natives the process of developing a nation’s consciousness, colonizers will reinforce ideas of racialized cultures so as to confuse any cohesive justifications for the native people's nationhood.
While Cesaire introduced to me the concept of decivilization as an externality of colonialism, it was not until I saw the scenes of colonial violence and its consequences in Concerning Violence that I realized the raw truth of this statement. In this film, we see colonizers who twist their minds to morally justify colonialism and we see freedom fighters pushed to brutality. I had known that colonialism decivilized the colonizer, but I had never thought that it functioned to decivilize the native as well.

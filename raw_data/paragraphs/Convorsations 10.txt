I was surprised to see the wide range of how each religion can be interpreted as either morally justifying, and in the case of Christianity fundamental to, capitalism or it can be interpreted as antithetical to capitalism rejecting almost every feature of its morality. For Christianity, evidence of the former can be found in the reading about The Protestant Ethic and in Micheal Novak’s response to the question “Has capitalism become incompatible with christianity?’ Evidence of the latter is Pope Francis’s comments about markets and inequality and Salsman's essay about the Christianity and the welfare state. My personal belief after these readings is that Catholicism appears to be diametrically opposed to the morality of capitalism in almost every respect whereas Protestantism, specifically Puritanism, has at least some moral justifications for capitalism as a vehicle to promote work ethic, asceticism, and success, as said by Weber, and in my opinion, to promote integrity and honesty. Ultimately, I believe that Christianity’s internal conflict with the capitalist system that creates so much wealth and yet so much inequality has, as argued by Salsman, led to a middle ground for many Christians politically to support some form of a welfare state.
I know very little about Islam and sharia law so, after the readings, I was surprised to find that at least Sorman contends that Islam is morally accepting of many foundational facets of capitalism like entrepreneurship and seeking wealth without guilt. The restrictions on joint-stock companies, the dispersion of inheritance, and the prohibition of interest seem to me to be no more serious hampers on capitalism than the laws and morality dictated by Christianity.  It makes sense, therefore, that Sorman blames the shoddy state of capitalism on tyrannical and unstable governments established after decolonization more so than sharia law.

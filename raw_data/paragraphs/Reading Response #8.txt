The 1981 World Bank Report argues for growth oriented policies in the agricultural sector like the privatization of farms, reforming price controls on agricultural goods, and investment in agricultural research of Sub-Saharan Africa. Many if not all of their solutions involve greater privatization and less government interventions. Anecdotal and statistical data from throughout the African continent is presented to support these capitalist reforms with the apparent hope that they will inspire some development in the industry. 
Bamako explores how ex-colonial powers have held down and stolen from Africa even in the post-colonial era. Similar to Kauonui’s argument about settler colonialism, neo-colonialism in Africa is shown to be a structure maintained by Western powers. While the structure of neo-colonialism in post-colonial Africa is not intended towards genocide, it has, similar to settler colonialism, functioned as a tool for the exploitation of their land. 
Before watching Bamako and before Monday’s lecture, I held the misconception that much if not all of Africa’s economic falters resulted simply from corruption and ineffective governance after decolonization destabilized the continent. While these factors may have played a role in this, I was unaware of the West’s imposition of structural adjustment and the significant part it had in much of Africa’s suffering.

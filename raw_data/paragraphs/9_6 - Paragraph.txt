Berger refers to a ‘language of images’ as the use of art and other visuals as a form of or supplement to communication. Images - like words - have no authority of their own but form a powerful force for expression when used as a language. Today, that language of images is most accurately embodied in memes. The culture around memes, today, sways public discourse and has become an essential tool in the expression of public sentiment. I, like most of us who exist in the presence of social media, have become as literate as one can try to be in memes, but their transience makes complete literacy an impossibility. Memes and other images surround us on the Internet and often make their way into day to day conversations over text. Literacy in the ‘language of images’ can skew how we interpret art of the past if we approach that art as language. It can reduce art to a message. A means to end in communication. But I try to avoid assigning meanings to works of art from both the past and present. There is a sharp distinction between art and images of language. Though one can at times be the other, art conveys an experience - images of language convey a meaning.

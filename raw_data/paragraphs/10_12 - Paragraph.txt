On Sunday, the newest episode of the Game of Thrones prequel, House of Dragons, came out and it was dark. The centerpiece of the episode was a dying king struggling to put together his family as it falls apart as a result of his failures in life. Death was ever present in the episode, not in the sense that people were constantly dying, but death was always around the corner for the king and it was grim to see him fight weakly against it.

My break was not raucous with music as much of it was spent attempting to focus, but I did get the chance to listen to some of my old playlists in the car with my girlfriend. These songs made me feel vaguely nostalgic for a time now gone, but more so glad that I had moved forward from that time (in that I now listen to better music).

Hickey believes that art is intrinsically without value but can derive value from the sum of public opinion and interpretation surrounding it (204). Tarkovsky similarly believes that art derives its purpose and therefore its value from the consumer (1). Hickey establishes that he believes that the art world defines the value of art. In doing so, it “conducts an ongoing referendum on how things should look and the way we should look at things” (204). Tarkovsky expresses a similar idea, in that art defines its value through its ability to “explain to the artist himself and to those around him what man lives for, what is the meaning of his existence” (1). The two are alike in their thought that art finds its worth through its capability to reflect and represent the human experience. The key difference between them is that Tarkovsky gives agency to the art itself as it defines its own value and Hickey removes that agency and instead ascribes it solely to the audience.

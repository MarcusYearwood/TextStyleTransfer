Each of the reviewer’s expectations were defined by the greatness of the previous movie. They both acknowledged how the previous movie maintained a strong narrative even in moments where it may have also been doing service to the Marvel franchise, a characteristic both reviewers feel the new Black Panther movie could not replicate. Moreover, they both touch on how the script at times could limit the actors performances more so than it did in the previous film. Ultimately, they come to similar conclusions with regard to their criteria based on the original Black Panther film: this movie was a faithful sequel but a flawed one at that. Both the Little White Lies article and the New Yorker article assume their reader has some knowledge of superhero movies and the Marvel franchise specifically. Bunsie mentions the term “Phase 4” a term specific to the MCU that only Marvel fans/viewers would recognize and  Brody that the reader has at least seen the first Black Panther film as much of his evaluation is based on it. These reviews use the bare minimum of description in their evaluation introducing only the initial characters and their initial relationship to each other. Many of their evaluations do not criticize specific moments in the plot or developments in any of the characters (likely because they were asked not to) rather they tend to evaluate thematic successes and failures. The New Yorker ventures into the realm of evaluating developments but only with the movie's introductory events and nothing beyond that. Each of the reviews show just enough of the story to get their reader thinking about what certain plot points may mean but not enough to reveal the story at large as they generally only reveal the bare minimum necessary for their evaluation.

Marx’s definition of capitalism, or at least my approximation derived from all the readings, is that it is a system developed out of feudal societies as their replacement which rested private property from the hands of the aristocracy, into the hands of the bourgeois. This system places immense value on capital. More specifically, it focuses its energies on increasing the profit that capital has the potential to produce. Class divisions emerge as a result of a person’s relationship to capital since there are those who own the capital and the means of its production opposed to those who simply labor alongside the means of production to create profit for the owners. As it relates to labor, capitalism extracts as much productive value out of them for the lowest cost to achieve the highest profit margins. The essence of the Marxist critique, therefore, is that society should not value capital more than it values itself. To go further, the essence of the critique is that private property has corrupted the human condition. 
Marx praises the ability of capitalism, practically, to produce and innovate through rapid development of the means of production and its incredible potential to self-replicate around the world creating sprawling and impossibly complex social markets, but he critiques the impersonal machines that are established alongside these development which use labor simply as another factor in the means of production. 
One can draw several connections between arguments against commercialism (the precursor to affluenza) and Marx’s belief in transcendence from private property. As was illustrated in Dworkin’s and Sandel’s essays, the arguments about the anti-social consequence of markets and bourgeois private-property within society are derived from Marxist thought. A society in which we connect solely to what we have, they all argue, is a society which prevents us from connecting to each other.

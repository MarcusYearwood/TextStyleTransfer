As of now, I support capitalism over any other form of societal governance, but acknowledging its many blind spots, I am in favor of a more mixed system that can address the failure cases of capitalism. Capitalism is an endlessly turning wheel that drives us each day towards greater technological advancements increasing the standard of living for everyone, regardless of class, at an exponential rate. Capitalism is incredibly dynamic and adaptable as it is guided by the demands of its constituents. That being said, capitalism also produces massive amounts of waste, encourages negative externalities like climate change, and enshrines inequity. For such instances as these, I believe there must be a body that limits the extent to which capitalism can function counter to our interests. The confusion I have as it relates to my own political philosophy is how much a governing entity should limit capitalism so as to maximize its dynamism and innovation as well as minimizing its externalities. 
As my position on mixed-capitalism is far from set in stone, I am certain that my opinions of the system will develop at least slightly and they may perhaps develop beyond recognition. I am greatly opposed to the combination of capital and government (that is, money in politics) so I can see myself changing my perspective on capitalism if I am convinced beyond any doubt that “crony capitalism” (as was illustrated in “Why Capitalism Doesn’t Work”) is inevitable in a mixed system. 
In my journey for towards a more concrete personal political philosophy, I believe it to be paramount that I analyze as many of the proposed societal systems as possible and in taking this class, I hope to gain a deep knowledge of at least capitalism and perhaps at least a shallower understanding of its peers (ie. socialism, communism, anarchism, etc.)

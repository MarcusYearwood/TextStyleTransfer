I’m drawn to this One Republic song almost entirely because of its use in Top Gun: Maverick, although the way in which it emanates positivity and a sense of nostalgia for summers past influences my attraction to it. I think any song that I crave to listen to has some connection to a feeling that I am seeking. Whether it be a song that represents a calm and warm day spent doing only what I wish to do and nothing more, a song that represents the love of Christmas with family, or a song that represents a good night out. That sense of representation can either come from a direct association with the context in which I heard a song the first time or first few times, or it can come from the general vibe of the song if it is constructed well enough. I think many people connect with music in this way. That is, many people are drawn to songs by their ‘vibe.’ If a song resonates with a person’s life experience then that person will enjoy that song
The value of negative criticism can not be seen immediately. Negative criticism in the few moments after it is released can only serve to make an experience more negative for both the audience and the creator. Negative criticism derives its value from its capability to improve future art. If someone creates a work that is poorly received, the negative criticism they face will inspire them to make slight alterations to their process which may therefore make their next work better. If it doesn’t, they can continue to iterate through this process of creation and criticism until it does.

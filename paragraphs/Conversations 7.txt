As others have mentioned before me, the readings this week dived much further into Keynes’s economic criticism of capitalism and his prescription to ‘save’ it. Central to many of the arguments made against Keynes (more specifically against his General Theory) was the idea that it unjustly threw out established economic theory that is foundational to classical and laissez-faire economics only to replace those theories with new ones that deviate even further from reality. Salsman argues that, in disregarding Say’s Law, Keynesian economics is effectively baseless because Keynes is prescribing a solution to a problem (the problem of disproportionate aggregate demand to aggregate supply in a state of full employment) that, in effect, does not really exist within the workings of capitalism. Rueff also heavily criticized the Keynesian misrepresentation of aggregate demand and the “liquidity preference” arguing that the market forces will not allow aggregate supply to create significant excess because the price mechanism will motivate actors within a capitalist system to work in areas for which there is greater demand and, to the latter point, that the preference to hold cash is dynamically determined by the participants in a market and therefore does not have a fixed impact on the money supply. Simpson makes the argument that Keynes charges the liquidity preference with being the cause of economic depressions, when in reality that relationship is the other way around. Inflationary expansion promotes spending and contractions in the economy promote saving according to Simpson. Moreover, he argues that saving is, counter to Keynes’s beliefs, actually beneficial to an economy as it is closely tied with greater economic stability. All of the criticisms of Keynes’s economic theory were from the capitalist position which argued, explicitly or implicitly, in favor of a freer market and against any socialist interventions as those interventions would have downstream consequences that the market could handle without supervision or excessive regulation.

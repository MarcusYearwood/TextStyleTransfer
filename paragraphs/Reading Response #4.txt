Lee argues that the Fu Manchu mustache functioned synecdochally to represent many misconceptions about the Chinese and, more broadly, Southeast Asians most prominently representing the threat of the 'yellow peril' to white civilization. Dating back to Early Modern European plays, Asia was often cast as a terrible, invading force from the East (Lee, 126). When the mandarin mustache replaced turbans and scimars to indicate anything Oriental, it similarly became associated with the menacing characters that often were themselves representative of the threat of Asia (Lee, 130).
Building on the perspective of Dunbar-Ortiz, Said expands on America's identity as a settler colonial nation by highlighting its expansionary colonial tendencies. The war in Iraq, for example, used similar justifications for foreign intervention as colonial powers did in their invasions of Africa and the Americas (Said, xix-xx). America, however, subtly but distinctly frames its actions as 'the spread of democracy' rather than 'the spread of modernity’
In Lee’s presentation, there was a brief mention of the ‘fox eye’ as a trend in makeup derived from the natural features of Southeast Asians. I have seen this style before on celebrities and amongst internet star’s, most if not all of them white, but I did not connect it to the Asian eye it quite obviously seeks to imitate. This, along with several other examples, forced me to reevaluate the extent to which Asian culture is appropriated and misused even today.

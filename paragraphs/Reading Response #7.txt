Okihiro argues that the black power movement in the US emerged as a consequence of the Third World liberation movements and the discourse around anti-colonialism (Okihiro, 36). Moreover, he asserts that the Third World liberation movement has roots in racialized politics which made its impact on black power all the more relevant (Okihiro, 26). He points to the Black Panthers as they considered the US government to be a colonizing force and African Americans as colonial subjects (Okihiro, 34-35).
As Cesaire speaks on the decivilizing force of colonization and refers to Nazism as an extension of colonialism, Moyn describes the Western human rights movement as a reaction to World War II (Cesaire, 90). Therefore, as Cesaire might argue, human rights was a reaction to colonialism and the movement occured because of Nazism's relationship to colonialism.
Though I have read much about domestic politics in modern Chinese history, I never associated the rise of China under Mao with the global collective liberation movement in the post-WWII era. Moreover, I knew of China's distaste for the two powers of the Cold War but I had not considered that this sentiment might have inspired China's role in the emergence of third world alliances (Prashad, 37).

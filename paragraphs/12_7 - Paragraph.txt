Change: My confidence level, with respect to writing, has increased dramatically by at least a point and a half (from a 7 to a 8.5). I think I now am confident in my ability to produce larger essays than I have ever written previously with a high quality within a relatively short period of time, given enough focus and attention on the essay. Moreover, I have learned to become especially confident with my ability to write analysis and synthesis as that is something I’ve come to enjoy and find a greater appreciation for over the course of this class. I feel like I’ve shaken off any rust that may have grown in my gap year and I’m more prepared to write academically and more generally communicate effectively through writing.
Takeaways: I think I have certainly improved my academic writing style by focusing specifically on organization and tangible methods of engaging an audience through writing. Though, I’m not certain if I have achieved the abstract goal of being able to convey my character in a text (whatever I meant by that), I think I’ve certainly attained skills that move me closer to that goal.
Engaging points of the class: I enjoyed writing in various formats throughout this class. It forced me to become more dynamic and think more flexibly about the way I structure essays, the way I use tone and diction, and about the many ways in which different styles suit different settings for writing.

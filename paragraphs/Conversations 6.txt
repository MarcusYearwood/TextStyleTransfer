Much of what we read consisted of Keynes’s moral criticism of capitalism and of communism, but it was quite interesting to note how much these criticisms have changed the economies we exist in today. Moreover, Keynes’s distaste towards the “money motive” (morally not practically) was surprising to me as his contribution to the economic system, to the extent of my knowledge at least, does little to fundamentally alter what seems to be his biggest gripe with capitalism. He went so far as to describe the instinct as “a somewhat disgusting morbidity,” but explained the inconsistency between his moral qualms and economic suggestions by stating later in his Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren that “Avarice and usury and precaution must be our gods for a little longer still” until we can afford to be rid of them. Therefore, despite his disdain for the morality produced by capitalism, he believes that this morality is necessary until the system has compounded enough such that the needs of everyone can be provided for. 
Before these readings, I had known Keynes primarily in the context of the economic policies that are employed to control the boom-bust cycle, but I was not aware of his affinity towards protectionist policies. In the context of his time, this sentiment is intuitive as the world was facing the immense instability of a post World War economy and recent experience had shown that global markets could just as easily pull down a country’s economy as it had pushed them up. In his National Self-Sufficiency he explores the moral reasoning for protectionist policies (that is, those that protect the national production of goods “whenever it is reasonably and conveniently possible”) as well as the practical concluding that a self-sufficient nation is more free, more peaceful, and more in control of its own fate than a nation who relies too much on global markets and production.

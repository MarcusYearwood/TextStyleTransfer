A common theme I noticed throughout these readings was the incredible faith that libertarians have for markets to function as both a moral technology and economic power house. By extension, there was also a theme of disdain for the over-reaching of governments (or in some cases for governments altogether). To the libertarian, government, as Rothbard expounds upon, is the root of most if not all of the economic problems we face as a society. The solution to those problems, therefore, is to establish freed markets in place of inefficient government bureaucracies. 
I found the way in which libertarians argued around the issue of inequality to be very interesting and almost counterintuitive to the notions I had previously accepted about capitalism. Specifically, the Rawlsian concept that it is better to divide up the pie unequally and make a bigger pie than to divide up a smaller pie equally and Chartier’s suggestion that Markets Undermine Privilege challenge what I think to be the traditional idea that capitalism (as defined as a system where private property is exchanged within free markets) enshrines inequality and therefore leaves the 90% worse off. Johnson engages with this dichotomy head on arguing that capitalism (as defined by a system where there exists a symbiosis between business and government) is the root of such inequalities and therefore the traditional notion holds some water, though only in the case of the statist-allied definition of capitalism. I am curious to see empirically whether Chartier’s theory of MUP actually applies across the board in the places where government intervention has been entrenched as a societal norm like K-12 education.
